# The Sunken Village of Coral Veil

*Adventure for 4 characters of level 6-7, designed for 2-3 sessions*

## Overview

Beneath the massive watering hole north of the Bottomless Goat lies Coral Veil, an ancient sea elf settlement that has existed in quiet isolation for centuries. The village was founded by sea elves who fled coastal wars of ages past, seeking refuge in this unlikely inland location—a vast underwater cavern system fed by deep aquifers connected to distant seas.

Several weeks ago, a Water-aspected Aether Orb drifted into their territory, carried by deep currents. The orb's elemental resonance has attracted an Aboleth named **Veth'sora**, an ancient creature that has claimed the orb and begun corrupting the village's inhabitants through psychic domination.

The sea hags Mishko encountered previously are not native to Coral Veil—they arrived in Veth'sora's wake, drawn by psychic emanations and opportunity.

## Connection to Campaign

- **Mishko's Earlier Encounter**: Mishko swam into the watering hole previously but encountered sharks and sea hags, preventing deeper exploration
- **Aether Orb Collection**: This is the second orb the party can acquire (Water aspect), following the Necrotic orb from the Bone Mill
- **Varrick's Interest**: Varrick will take notice of the party collecting multiple orbs

---

## Adventure Hook

The morning after their victory at the Bone Mill, an unusual visitor appears at the Bottomless Goat: a sea elf woman has dragged herself from the watering hole and collapsed on the northern edge of the property.

> *The figure lying in the grass is unlike anyone you've seen in Briar Hollow. Her skin carries the blue-green tint of deep water, and delicate fins frame her pointed ears. Gills flutter weakly at her throat as she struggles to breathe the open air. Strange, translucent burns mark her forearms, weeping a viscous fluid that smells of brine and something fouler beneath.*

### Thalindra Wavecrest

When revived ([[/check Medicine 12]] or any healing magic), Thalindra speaks in halting Common:

> *"Please... the Coral Veil... my people... something has come. Something old. It speaks in our minds, makes us forget ourselves. My grandmother... she resisted long enough to send me. The bright stone—it called the horror to us. You must help, or we are lost."*

**Information Thalindra Can Provide:**
- Coral Veil is a village of ~60 sea elves in underwater caverns beneath the watering hole
- Three weeks ago, a glowing orb drifted in, pulsing with water magic
- Days later, a creature of nightmare arrived—ancient, three-eyed, with tentacles dripping burning slime
- The creature resides in the Pearlheart Chamber, where the orb now rests
- Many villagers are mentally controlled; others hide in outer tunnels
- Sea hags came afterward as opportunistic scavengers
- Her grandmother, Elder Coralline, leads resistance efforts

**Important:** Thalindra cannot survive long out of water. The party's Decanter of Endless Water can keep her comfortable, or she can wait in the shallows.

---

## Part 1: The Descent

### Preparing for the Dive

The watering hole is approximately 200 feet deep before opening into the cavern system.

**Underwater Survival Options:**
- Mishko can breathe underwater naturally (Triton) and communicate with sea creatures
- Thalindra provides **4 Pearls of Water Breathing** (8 hours each, held in mouth)
- Creative solutions: Decanter of Endless Water for air bubbles, potions, etc.

> *The watering hole stretches before you, its surface deceptively calm. Sunlight penetrates only the first thirty feet before giving way to blue-green twilight. Somewhere far below, in the lightless depths, an entire people await rescue—or doom.*

### The Descent (Skill Challenge)

**Navigation Check:** [[/check Survival 13]]
- **Success:** Efficient navigation through current channels
- **Failure:** Disoriented, +30 minutes travel time, potentially alerts patrols

### Hazard: The Hag's Toll

Approximately 80 feet down, the party enters the sea hags' territory.

> *The water grows murky here, thick with sediment and something else—a greasy, unnatural film that clings to your skin. Amid the floating detritus, you spot crude fetishes made of bone and kelp, strung between rocky outcroppings like a grotesque curtain. Beyond them, shadows move with predatory patience.*

**The Three Sea Hags** (MM stats) are opportunists who've been preying on fleeing sea elves.

**Resolution Options:**

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Combat** | Fight viciously, flee at half strength |
| **Payment** | Magical item OR "secrets that cut deep" (verified by *detect thoughts*) OR future service |
| **Intimidation** | [[/check Intimidation 16]] - Mention Marrow Titan victory, show necrotic orb |
| **Deception** | [[/check Deception 15]] - Claim to serve a greater power |

**Hag Personalities:**
- **Murkmaw** (leader): Calculating, speaks in riddles, collects teeth
- **Scabrine**: Impulsive, violent, easily goaded
- **Weeping Nell**: Melancholic, fixated on lost beauty, might be swayed by sympathy

---

## Part 2: Coral Veil

### Entering the Village

> *The tunnel widens suddenly, and you emerge into a space that steals your breath. A vast cavern stretches before you, easily a quarter mile across, its ceiling lost in darkness above. Bioluminescent coral in soft blues, greens, and purples clings to every surface, casting the space in ethereal twilight.*
>
> *What was once clearly a thriving village now feels like a place holding its breath. Elegant structures carved from living coral and mother-of-pearl stand in concentric rings around a central chamber that pulses with an unsettling, rhythmic glow. The streets are empty—but you sense movement in the shadows, watching.*

### Village Layout

| Ring | Contents |
|------|----------|
| **Outer Ring** | Abandoned homes, signs of struggle |
| **Middle Ring** | Communal buildings, school, healing house—some survivors hiding |
| **Inner Ring** | Administrative buildings, elder's chambers |
| **Pearlheart Chamber** | Sacred center, now corrupted—aboleth and orb location |

### The Survivors

~20 sea elves remain free, hiding in outer tunnels, led by **Elder Coralline**.

**Key Information from Coralline:**
- The aboleth calls itself Veth'sora, claims to be "reclaiming what was always theirs"
- ~30 villagers are enthralled, patrolling inner rings
- The creature has psychic reach throughout the village—it knows intruders arrived
- Killing the aboleth won't immediately free the enthralled; they need to be kept alive and away from water for the curse to break
- The orb is embedded in the central altar, pulsing with Veth'sora's heartbeat

**Coralline's Request:**
> *"I will not ask you to spare all who have fallen. Some... may be beyond saving. But my daughter, Thalindra's mother—Pearlescent—she was among the first taken. She serves now as the creature's voice. If there is any way to bring her back..."*

---

### Village Exploration

#### Location: The Healing House

> *This dome-shaped structure of pale pink coral was once a place of gentle care. Beds of woven kelp line the walls, and shelves hold countless glass vials and ceramic pots. Some have been smashed, their contents clouding the water.*

**Loot:**
- 4 Potions of Healing ([[/damage 2d4+2 healing]])
- 2 Potions of Greater Healing ([[/damage 4d4+4 healing]])
- 1 Potion of Resistance (Psychic)
- Healer's Kit (8 uses)

**Encounter - Healer Orin (Enthralled):**

> *A sea elf man drifts in the corner, eyes glazed with oily sheen. Mucus drips from his gills, movements jerky, unnatural. When he speaks, it is in two voices—his own, frightened and distant, and something deeper that resonates in your skull.*
>
> *"You should not have come. The Eternal One sees. The Eternal One knows. Leave... please leave... THE ETERNAL ONE HUNGERS."*

- **Combat:** Use Scout stats (swim 40 ft.), takes 3d6 psychic damage if resisting commands
- **Non-Combat:** [[/check Persuasion 15]] or [[/check Insight 14]] appealing to his healer nature causes him to hesitate 1 minute

---

#### Location: The School

> *Small desks of carved stone sit in neat rows, each with slate tablet and chalk stylus. Murals on walls depict sea elf history—flight from war, discovery of this cavern, generations of peaceful life. The newest mural, still incomplete, shows a dark shape with three eyes looming over the village.*

**Discovery - Ripple (Child Survivor):**
A young sea elf girl (~10 years old) hides here, clutching a stuffed seahorse toy.

**What Ripple Knows:**
- There's a "back way" into the Pearlheart Chamber (maintenance tunnel)
- Her father is an enthralled guard; she's been watching him
- The creature "talks in dreams"—even free sea elves have nightmares

**Ripple's Secret:** She has a **Ring of Water Walking** and will give it to the party if they promise to save her father.

---

#### Location: The Armory

> *This building bears marks of fierce struggle—doors torn from hinges, walls cracked, dark stains on the floor. Weapon racks line the walls, most empty, but some equipment remains.*

**Loot:**
- 2 Tridents +1 (extra [[/damage 1d6 cold]] when fully submerged)
- 1 Net of Entangling ([[/save STR 13]] to escape instead of cutting)
- Cloak of the Manta Ray

---

#### Encounter: Village Patrol

4 Enthralled Sea Elves (Guard stats, swim 40 ft.) led by **Sergeant Kelvar**.

> *They move with eerie synchronization, eyes empty, movements puppet-like. The lead warrior, broad-shouldered with a scarred face, raises his trident: "The Eternal One demands your submission. Kneel, and know peace. Resist, and know only suffering."*

**Notes:**
- Enthralled fight to incapacitate (aboleth wants new thralls)
- Kelvar can be saved if defeated but not killed

---

## Part 3: The Pearlheart Chamber

### Approaches

| Option | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **A: Front Entrance** | 6 enthralled + 2 Hunter Sharks; direct but allows retreat |
| **B: Ripple's Tunnel** | [[/check Stealth 14]] group check; single file; advantage on initiative |
| **C: Distraction** | Coralline draws away half guards; risk of survivor casualties |

### The Chamber

> *The Pearlheart Chamber takes your breath away despite the horror that has claimed it. A dome of living coral rises a hundred feet overhead, every surface covered in luminescent organisms pulsing in slow, hypnotic rhythm. At the center, a great altar of mother-of-pearl cradles an orb the size of a human head—it swirls with captured ocean currents, blues and greens dancing within.*
>
> *But the beauty is corrupted. Tendrils of dark mucus web the chamber like a spider's nest. And there, coiled around the altar like a dragon guarding its hoard, is the source of Coral Veil's suffering.*
>
> *The aboleth is ancient and horrible—a fish-like body easily twenty feet long, covered in mucus that clouds the water. Three baleful eyes fix upon you with intelligence that predates civilization. When it speaks, the voice resonates directly in your mind.*
>
> *"Ah. The surfacers. I felt you the moment you entered my domain. You carry the stink of death-magic—the bone-orb's resonance. Did you think to collect another? This one is MINE."*

## Victory and Aftermath

> *The aboleth's death cry is not a sound but a sensation—a psychic shockwave rippling through water, minds, coral. The enthralled collapse, puppet strings cut. Corruption dissipates, and for the first time, you see the true beauty of the Pearlheart Chamber—ancient, sacred, finally free.*
>
> *The Water Aether Orb pulses gently on the altar, chaotic swirling calming to gentle, rhythmic flow. It feels... waiting.*

**Claiming the Orb:**
> *The orb is cool in your hands—the temperature of a clear mountain stream on a summer day. Within it, you see not just water but the essence of water—tides and currents, gentle rain and raging tsunamis, the lifeblood of the world. It accepts your touch. It is yours now—another piece of a puzzle you are only beginning to understand.*
