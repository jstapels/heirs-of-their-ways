# Aether Orb (Water Aspect)
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

A fist-sized sphere swirling with miniature ocean currents; distant whale song hums when held.

**Properties:**
- You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
- You have resistance to cold damage.
- Once per long rest, you can cast *Control Water* without expending a spell slot.
- You can sense the approximate direction of other Aether Orbs within 1 mile.

**Dual Orb Effect:** When carried alongside the Necrotic Aether Orb, the bearer experiences unsettling visions of drowning or decay.

**Source:** Recovered from the Pearlheart Chamber after defeating Veth'sora.
