A broad-shouldered sea elf with scarred features and a trident at the ready. Once responsible for village security, he now leads enthralled patrols through the rings of Coral Veil.

## Biography {.system.details.biography.value}
- Uses guard statistics with swim speed 40 ft.
- Commands small groups of enthralled villagers and reports directly to Pearlescent.
