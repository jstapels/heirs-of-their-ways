# Elder Coralline Wavecrest
*Sea elf druid and leader of Coral Veil*

An elderly sea elf with silver-blue skin, white hair that drifts like seafoam, and storm-gray eyes full of grief and resolve. Her robes are woven from kelp and shells; she leans on a white coral staff topped with a softly glowing pearl.

## Biography {.system.details.biography.value}
- Village matriarch guiding ~20 free sea elves in the outer tunnels.
- Sent Thalindra to the surface while she organizes resistance against Veth'sora.
- Knows the aboleth's name (Veth'sora), the count of enthralled villagers, and that enthrallment can be broken if victims are kept alive and away from water.
- Begs for a chance to save her daughter Pearlescent if possible.

## Roleplaying Notes
- Speaks slowly and deliberately; protective of her people above all else.
- Pragmatic about losses but clings to hope for family.
- Offers tactical guidance, coordinates distractions, and provides rewards if the village survives.
