# Pearlescent Wavecrest
*Enthralled lieutenant and voice of Veth'sora*

Thalindra's mother, once a poised sea elf warrior now moving with unsettling fluidity as the aboleth speaks through her. Her eyes are filmed with opalescent mucus and her voice harmonizes with Veth'sora's psychic presence.

## Biography {.system.details.biography.value}
- Among the first villagers taken; now serves as Veth'sora's primary lieutenant.
- Uses veteran stats with swim speed 40 ft., resistance to psychic damage, and *command* at will (DC 13).
- Brief flashes of her true self surface mid-fight ("Run... please run... I can't stop...").
- Can be saved if knocked unconscious and kept away from the water; otherwise dies with a final moment of clarity.

## Roleplaying Notes
- Represents the emotional heart of the boss encounter.
- Will target the strongest-looking hero under Veth'sora's orders.
