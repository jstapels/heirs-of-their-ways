# Coral Veil

*Location: Underwater cavern system beneath the watering hole north of the Bottomless Goat*

An ancient sea elf settlement that has existed in quiet isolation for centuries, now threatened by an aboleth drawn by an Aether Orb.

## Overview

Coral Veil was founded by sea elves who fled coastal wars of ages past, seeking refuge in this unlikely inland location—a vast underwater cavern system fed by deep aquifers connected to distant seas. For generations, they lived peacefully, their presence unknown to surface dwellers.

## Access

### The Watering Hole

A massive body of water north of the Bottomless Goat:
- Approximately 200 feet deep before opening into cavern system
- Surface appears calm and deceptively normal
- Sunlight penetrates only the first 30 feet
- Previous visitors: Mishko encountered sharks and sea hags, couldn't explore deeper

### The Descent

The 200-foot water column presents challenges:
- Navigation through current channels
- Sea hag territory at approximately 80 feet depth
- Darkness increases with depth
- Opens into vast cavern system at bottom

## The Village

### Geography

> *A vast cavern stretches before you, easily a quarter mile across, its ceiling lost in darkness above. Bioluminescent coral in soft blues, greens, and purples clings to every surface, casting the space in an ethereal twilight.*

**Notable Features:**
- Quarter-mile wide main cavern
- Bioluminescent coral illumination (blues, greens, purples)
- Structures carved from living coral and mother-of-pearl
- Concentric ring layout around central sacred chamber
- Stagnant pools and aquifer connections

### Layout

| Ring | Purpose | Current State |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Outer Ring** | Residential homes | Abandoned, signs of struggle |
| **Middle Ring** | Communal spaces | Some survivors hiding |
| **Inner Ring** | Administrative | Under aboleth control |
| **Pearlheart Chamber** | Sacred center | Corrupted, aboleth lair |

### Key Locations

#### The Healing House
Dome-shaped structure of pale pink coral. Beds of woven kelp, shelves of medicinal vials and pots. Some damaged from conflict.

#### The School
Small carved stone desks in neat rows with slate tablets. Murals depicting sea elf history—their flight from war, discovery of the cavern, generations of peace. Newest mural (incomplete) shows a three-eyed dark shape looming over the village.

#### The Armory
Bears marks of fierce struggle—doors torn off, walls cracked, dark stains. Most weapon racks empty.

#### The Pearlheart Chamber

The sacred center of Coral Veil:

> *A dome of living coral rises a hundred feet overhead, every surface covered in luminescent organisms that pulse in a slow, hypnotic rhythm. At the center, a great altar of mother-of-pearl cradles the Aether Orb.*

**Current State (Corrupted):**
- Tendrils of dark mucus web the chamber
- Walls glisten with oily residue
- Aboleth Veth'sora coiled around the altar
- Water Aether Orb embedded in central altar

## Population

### Before the Crisis
- Approximately 60 sea elves
- Peaceful, isolated community
- Led by spiritual elders
- Traders with deep-sea communities via aquifer connections

### Current Status
- ~30 villagers enthralled by aboleth
- ~20 survivors hiding in outer tunnels
- Led by Elder Coralline Wavecrest
- Under psychic siege

## History

### Founding
Sea elves fled coastal wars generations ago, discovering the underwater cavern system. They built Coral Veil as a hidden sanctuary, using bioluminescent coral and mother-of-pearl construction.

### The Crisis (Three Weeks Ago)
1. Water Aether Orb drifted into territory via deep currents
2. Orb's elemental resonance attracted the aboleth Veth'sora
3. Aboleth claimed the orb, began psychic domination
4. Sea hags arrived in its wake, opportunistic predators
5. Village divided between enthralled and free survivors

## Current Threats

### Veth'sora, the Eternal Dreamer
An ancient aboleth that has claimed the Aether Orb:
- Resides in Pearlheart Chamber
- Psychic reach throughout village
- Controls ~30 enthralled villagers
- Served by dominated sharks
- Claims to be "reclaiming what was always theirs"

### Sea Hag Coven
Three hags established territory in the descent shaft:
- **Murkmaw** (leader): Calculating, speaks in riddles
- **Scabrine**: Impulsive, violent
- **Weeping Nell**: Melancholic, fixated on lost beauty
- Prey on fleeing sea elves
- Not allied with aboleth—opportunists

### Enthralled Villagers
Former residents now under aboleth control:
- Patrol inner rings
- Fight to capture, not kill (aboleth wants more thralls)
- Can be freed if kept alive and away from water
- Include warriors, healers, and civilians

## Notable Inhabitants

### Elder Coralline Wavecrest
Village spiritual leader, Thalindra's grandmother. Leads the resistance from hiding.

### Thalindra Wavecrest
Messenger sent to seek help. Cannot survive long out of water.

### Pearlescent Wavecrest
Thalindra's mother, among the first enthralled. Serves as aboleth's "voice" and lieutenant.

### Ripple
Young survivor (~10 years old) hiding in the school. Knows secret maintenance tunnel to Pearlheart Chamber.

### Healer Orin
Village healer, now enthralled. Retains some medical knowledge even corrupted.

## Resources

### Village Treasures
- Pearls of Water Breathing (village-crafted)
- Coral and pearl jewelry
- Medicinal supplies
- Magical weapons (tridents, nets)
- Ancient texts on sea elf history

### The Water Aether Orb
The crisis catalyst—a fey artifact pulsing with elemental water magic, now claimed by the aboleth.

## Adventure Significance

- **Connection to Campaign**: Located near party's home base
- **Aether Orb**: Second orb the party can acquire
- **Alliance Potential**: Rescued village offers underwater sanctuary and information
- **Varrick's Interest**: Another orb will draw his attention

## Future Potential

If the village is saved:
- Trade relationship with surface
- Information about underwater passages
- Ancient texts on Aether Orb origins
- Permanent underwater sanctuary for the party
- Sea elf allies for future conflicts
