# The Hunters

Aside from making exquisite wine, the Blackthorns are responsible for handling significant crimes in Loamvale. Although day-to-day protection is handled by the local guard, serious crimes and investigations fall to a group known as **The Hunters**.

## Organization Structure

Technically, The Hunters are a separate entity from House Blackthorn and can comprise anyone. However, historically it has primarily been made up of family members, especially in upper positions.

### Membership Requirement
Anyone who joins must give up their affiliation with their house. This ensures they remain unbiased in their work. Despite this stipulation, the relationship (and influence) between The Hunters and the Blackthorns is obvious.

### Symbol
Members wear a distinctive pin featuring a crossed sword and bow overlaid on a shield, symbolizing protection and vigilance.

## Reputation

The Hunters have impressive skills, particularly unparalleled in hunting certain individuals. Outside of Loamvale, they are known for bounty hunting and are often requested by other towns with serious problems.

## The Lodge

Perched atop the northern cliff where Loam Borough's three rivers converge, the Hunter's Lodge stands as a formidable structure overlooking the town.

### Architecture
- Crafted from sturdy timber and gray stone
- Tall, arched windows with sloped slate roof
- Blends rustic charm with imposing presence
- Large emblem at entrance (crossed sword and bow on shield)

### Facilities
- Meeting halls
- Training grounds
- Living quarters
- Shared spaces with other organizations

### Adjacent Buildings
The **Temple of the Harvest** sits next to the Lodge, fostering cooperation between defenders and spiritual caretakers of Loamvale.

## Prominent Members

### Aldric Stormwind
*Commander*

Human male, mid-50s. Disciplined and strategic, Aldric is a seasoned veteran respected for his leadership and combat prowess. He values duty and has a no-nonsense attitude.

He represents The Hunters at council meetings and oversees all major operations.

### Seraphine Willowbrook
*Lieutenant*

Half-elf female, appears around 35. Insightful and patient, Seraphine is known for her keen perception and mentorship of younger members.

*Note: Seraphine has a complicated family situation - her twin sister Sylvaine (now "Selene") has become entangled with darker powers.*

### Rogar Stonefist
*Master-at-Arms*

Dwarf male, age 120. Gruff but fair, Rogar is passionate about martial excellence and instilling discipline in new recruits.

### Alara "Swiftwind"
*Scout & Ranger*

Half-elf female. Steady, quick, and candid when the truth stings. She was the party's first formal contact with The Hunters and provided the critical link revealing Selene's identity.

Alara is actually a Willowbrook herself - younger sister to Seraphine and Sylvaine - but keeps the family name at arm's length to prove she can stand on her own. She maintains strong ties to her family and treats the Willowbrooks as her own.

Her motivations: keep Loamvale safe, keep The Hunters neutral, and - if possible - bring truth to light without forcing blood between the Willowbrook sisters.

## Current Operations

The Hunters have been preoccupied with events to the North in Xorketh, helping Arrowcross and keeping the northern border safe. This limited their ability to investigate the missing shipments, which led to the formation of the current adventuring party.

## Connection to Current Events

The Hunters maintain interest in:
- The Shadow Conspiracy (Lord Varrick, Lucien Darkwood)
- The activities of Selene/Sylvaine Willowbrook
- Any threats to Loamvale's stability
