# Loamvale Region

Loamvale is a region in the northeast of Mikill Fyrir, nestled in a valley that runs along the Xorketh border. The peculiar weather and specific soil content makes it an exceptional area for growing certain crops. The area is governed by five major households that specialize in various alcohol exports.

## Geography and Climate

Loamvale is situated in the northeast of Mikill Fyrir, just west of the mountains, along the border to Xorketh. The area is a valley of hills with a small river running down the center. The north side of the valley stretches up into the mountains while the south side is covered in a forest of trees. The river starts from springs and runoff in the west and flows east into Mimameidr's Tears before emptying into the ocean.

The weather in this region is quite unique. The dry cool air from North Veterlands blows eastward into the warm humid air that comes from the ocean. This strange mixture of weather fronts causes almost constant rainfall high up in the mountains, which then runs down into Loamvale. This creates local fields with rich loamy soil but very dry air, allowing for a perfect growing season for certain crops.

## Agriculture

Agriculture in Loamvale thrives in the paradoxical blend of climatic conditions. The loamy soil, enriched by centuries of mineral deposits from mountain run-offs, is fecund and robust. The constant rainfall high in the mountains nourishes the soil without over-saturating it, thanks to the unique dry air that blankets the land. The river that meanders through the valley provides steady irrigation during occasional dry spells.

### Crops
- **Staple Grains:** Barley, wheat, and rye cultivated for distillations and brews
- **Orchards:** Apples and pears for ciders and brandies
- **Herbs and Hops:** Essential flavors for ales and meads
- **Vineyards:** Curve along south-facing slopes, especially for Blackthorn wines
- **Vegetables and Fruits:** Rich garden produce for local cuisine

Agricultural practices blend age-old tradition with innovative techniques. Crop rotation and land stewardship ensure the land remains generous.

## Governance

Loamvale operates as an oligarchy, where five primary houses hold regional power. Due to its position along the border of Xorketh and Mykill Fyrir, the region has been left mostly autonomous, becoming an independent entity.

### The Five Great Houses

The five primary houses rose to prominence through their expertise in finely crafted drinks. Each house has perfected their craft and guards its secrets closely.

### Council Meetings

Once a month, a council meeting is held at one of the five estates where the heads of each house discuss regional matters and problems. As tradition, each house brings a bottle of their finest drink to share.
