# Session 14 - Vines, Valor, and Varrick?

## Key Events

The party ventured to the Vine and Valor Tavern to gather more information about Lucien Darkwood, hoping for loose tongues over drinks and good company.

### A Chance Encounter with Alderis Windchime

The party met Alderis Windchime, a traveling storyteller and chronicler of tales. She revealed that she had recently visited the Winter Court of the North Veterlands and met some of the noble figures there. Though hesitant to share too many details, she engaged in friendly conversation before the evening took a dramatic turn.

### Mishko's Bard Duel with Sterlyn

Sterlyn, a rival bard, confronted Mishko in the tavern, resentful of his reputation and recent absence. She accused him of overshadowing her and challenged him to a bardic duel. After initial reluctance, Mishko accepted with the entire tavern watching.

The duel consisted of three rounds of performances judged by the crowd. Mishko employed his full repertoire—dazzling footwork, mirror images, and a masterful tale about the mysterious "L.D."—while Sterlyn relied on flashy illusions and sharp lyrical jabs. Mishko's storytelling enthralled the audience, and he decisively humiliated Sterlyn, leaving her storming off in frustration.

His final verse revealed crucial information: "L.D. is Lucien." This revelation caught the interest of some patrons, especially a shadowy figure who visibly reacted to the name.

### A Tense Confrontation Between Seraphine and Selene

Outside the tavern, the group overheard a heated argument in an alleyway between Seraphiné (lieutenant of the Hunters) and Selene, whom they discovered were sisters. Seraphine was furious at Selene's allegiance to Varrick, calling him a "parasite" and accusing him of spreading blood magic.

Selene dismissed her sister's concerns, claiming Varrick understood her in ways Seraphine never did. The confrontation nearly escalated before a group of drunken patrons, riled up from the bard duel, turned their aggression on the Hunters, leading to a brawl.

### Alleyway Battle: Holding the Line

The party found themselves caught between drunk, aggressive mercenaries and the deadly feud between the sisters. The towering brawler Hector Stonefist proved to be a relentless opponent.

During the scuffle:
- Ilizar restrained Selene with Whisperthorn's vines, but she later broke free and escaped onto a rooftop
- Seraphiné's combat prowess was deadly, though she showed unsettling excitement at drawing blood
- Mishko's quick words convinced some fighters to surrender
- Hector remained relentless until Ilizar finally took him down
- Threk and Ilizar were knocked down at times, but Mishko and Mats kept the fight from turning against them

### Aftermath and Investigation

After the brawl, Seraphiné confronted the party, frustrated by their presence in the city. She demanded to know why they were there despite being under house arrest. Mishko stated they were searching for information on Lucien Darkwood, while Threk challenged Seraphiné about her priorities regarding her sister Selene and Aether Orbs.

Seraphiné, angered by their interference, dismissed the matter as a private family affair. Ilizar pushed the conversation to its breaking point, openly mocking the Hunters and demanding answers about Varrick. This led to a heated exchange, though Seraphiné ultimately confirmed that Varrick is a dangerous unseen force operating in Loamvale's shadows.

Threk stayed behind to speak with Crag Ironmaw, one of the brawlers. After a tense conversation and a bribe, Crag shared rumors of unnatural happenings in Briar Hollow—strange creatures, dark rituals, and haunting howls that began after the Hunters cleared parts of the eastern Towering Woods. He suggested seeking out Wulfric Hallowbane, a gruff old farmhand with no love for outsiders or the Hunters, noting that bringing good whiskey might be the only way to get him to talk.
