# Session 19 - Fowl Play and Matrimony Mayhem

## Key Events

### Redcap Rumble

As the afternoon sun dappled the forest floor, the heroes found themselves beset by a pack of vicious redcaps in a misty glade. The battle was intense and comically brutal:
- Threk was repeatedly battered and bloodied by a particularly nasty redcap, only to be heroically patched up by Mishko's healing touch and well-timed Bardic Inspiration
- Mats grappled, punched, and redirected attacks like a martial arts blender
- Ilizar's arrows found their marks with surgical precision
- The redcaps fought with wild, insulting shouts (mostly about mothers and dogs)

One by one, the redcaps fell—most with their skulls caved in, and all a little worse for meeting this crew.

### Clues in Crimson

In the aftermath, the party searched the strange little fae corpses and found cryptic scraps of parchment, each bearing a single word in Sylvan. Piecing them together—with a little bardic debate—they realized the words spelled "STEW" or possibly "WEST" depending on the order, but the former seemed to fit their rumbling stomachs and the mysterious poem they recalled:

> When sky's silver eye a**S**cends above
> The dancing hu**T** returns to roost we love
> In pale-lit glade, she'll strut with sil**E**nt grace
> A**W**aiting those who dare her hidden place

They also found giant chicken tracks—clear evidence that their legendary quarry (and the next verse of their strange adventure) was near.

### Lost in the Woods, Found at the Fence

Despite how yummy stew sounded, they convinced themselves they should head west. The party struck out into the dense woods, but their navigational skills left much to be desired. An hour west became three hours off course, and soon they stumbled into rocky hills and a mysterious picket fence. Rather than retreat, they followed the suggestion of the ever-helpful (and silent) Mr. Tip-Dip the goat, and approached the fence, hoping for shelter or answers.

### A Wolfish Reunion

To their shock, the fence belonged to Vargr, the intimidating leader of the local werewolf pack, and his allies—including Mats' former flame, Liora.

Vargr's greeting was suspicious (and slightly murderous), but Mats defused the tension with a very public marriage proposal to Liora, who promptly transformed, panicked, and fled into the woods. Vargr, stunned by both the sudden proposal and his own feelings about the recent bloodshed between their groups, agreed to a tense peace—for now. He and his pack returned to their cave, leaving the heroes to find their own way.

### Circling Back to the Glade

After some more misadventures with directions, and jokes about cartography and "pecker tracks," the group managed to retrace their steps and found their way back to the foggy glade as night settled in. They dragged the redcap corpses into the bushes, took a much-needed rest, and prepared for whatever the moonlit night might bring.

### The Hut with Chicken Legs

At moonrise, the ground began to shake, and with an ominous clatter, a giant hut on chicken legs stalked into the clearing, just as the old rhyme had foretold. It eyed the party suspiciously, swiped at Threk and Ilizar when they said the wrong thing ("hammer," apparently, was the wrong password), and finally settled and opened its door when Ilizar shouted the magic word: **"STEW!"**

### Into the Unknown

One by one, the heroes stepped into the hut's gaping door, vanishing into magical darkness. After a dizzying swirl, they found themselves in a brightly lit room with a teleportation circle—and a grinning imp who greeted them with:

**"Well, hello, hello, are you here to help with the stew?"**

## Cliffhanger
