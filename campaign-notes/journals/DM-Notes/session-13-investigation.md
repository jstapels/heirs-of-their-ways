# Session 13 - The Investigation is Afoot

## Key Events

The party found themselves under house arrest in Loamvale following accusations from a magically-altered letter. Ilizar rejoined the group after missing the Council meeting and learned of their predicament. Despite being confined to the city, the party remained optimistic they could prove their innocence.

### Visit to the Shadowtusk Estate

The group traveled to Threk's family estate, where guards reminded them they were only allowed on Shadowtusk lands under Threk's responsibility. They observed the rolling wildflower fields and famous beehives producing Shadowtusk Mead.

Inside, they met with Matriarch Tona Shadowtusk, who directed them to speak with Auger Crol, a long-lived Loxodon diviner. In Crol's cluttered study filled with tomes on ley lines, star-charts, and relics, he confirmed the party's suspicions about Aether Orbs and their power. Though he couldn't provide proof of who forged the incriminating letter, his hints about the orbs and the hunters' dealings in the north raised more questions.

As they left, Ilizar unsuccessfully attempted to eavesdrop on a private conversation between Threk and Crol, only to be thwarted by magical wards.

### Investigation at the Escrinos Estate

The party visited Ilizar's ancestral home, known for its apple orchards and famed hard cider. They were welcomed by Ilizar's relatives, including cousin Mateo and Isabella (who caught Mishko's attention). They enjoyed a meal featuring apples in nearly every dish.

The group asked Ilizar's father, Alejandro Escrinos, about "Lucien Darkwood" or "LD." Alejandro recalled reading about a "Lucien" in old ledgers referencing the Darkwood Estate's downfall. He allowed them to examine a seized financial ledger from the Darkwood Estate.

The ledger revealed evidence of arcane experimentation and mounting debts that eventually led to legal troubles and the estate's confiscation by Loamvale's Council. A scribbled-out note hinted at secret dealings or accomplices, though the exact words were unrecoverable.

## NPCs Encountered

- **Matriarch Tona Shadowtusk** - Threk's family matriarch, polite but firm
- **Auger Crol** - Long-lived Loxodon diviner with knowledge of Aether Orbs
- **Mateo** - Ilizar's cousin
- **Isabella** - Ilizar's relative who caught Mishko's interest
- **Alejandro Escrinos** - Ilizar's father

## Items Found

- Financial ledger from the Darkwood Estate (examined, then returned)

## Next Steps

Armed with ties between "LD," "Lucien," and the disgraced Darkwood family, the party realized someone with necromantic interests might be working against Loamvale's nobles—or seeking an Aether Orb. Though they lack direct proof of who forged the letter, their path forward is clearer: delve deeper into the Darkwood history, find where Lucien disappeared to, and prove their innocence before the Council.

Whispers of necromantic funding and "Lucien Darkwood" hung in the air, pushing the heroes to keep digging while remaining under the Hunters' watchful eye.
