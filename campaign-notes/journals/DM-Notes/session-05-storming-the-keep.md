# Session 5 - Storming the Keep

## Overview

After careful observation and planning, the party executes an assault on Stonebridge Keep. Despite some initial fumbles, they successfully infiltrate and clear out the bandits.

## Key Events

### Morning Preparation

- Group observes thieves collecting crates and boxes
- Mishko approaches north gate, claiming to be an entertainer

### Failed Negotiation

**Mishko's Deception Attempt:**
- Claims to be part of "Mystic Melodies" troupe
- Says they found dead humans and were attacked by two dozen brigands
- Seeks help to rescue friends
- Meets two bandits: Grünner (twitchy, eager to attack) and Cassius (spokesperson)
- Bandits uninterested in helping
- Cassius offers to let Mishko join them as they're leaving
- Conversation ends when Mishko asks where they're going
- Bottle of alchemist's fire thrown at Mishko
- Mishko rolls to extinguish flames, then retreats
- Casts spell creating a smelly fart next to Grünner
- Portcullis slams down blocking north entrance

### The Assault Plan

Group falls into indecision about approach. Eventually settles on:

1. Mishko casts fog cloud on north entrance (taking advantage of cloudy/misty weather)
2. Alara and Ilizar sneak to east side and climb wall
3. When they reach the top, signal with Hunter whistle
4. Threk and Mats charge front portcullis and lift it

**Execution:**
- Plan goes almost as intended
- Alara and Ilizar struggle with handholds but make it to the top
- Wall is mostly empty, they start shooting arrows
- Threk struggles to fully lift gate, only raises it a few feet
- Sufficient for Mats and eventually Mishko to get underneath
- Mishko casts enlarge on Threk
- Enlarged Threk easily lifts gate and gets inside

### The Battle

**Combat Highlights:**
- Bandits systematically taken down one after another
- Mats knocks one bandit unconscious for questioning
- Mats summons electricity, taking out multiple rogues
- Faces a tough-looking bandit who pleads for life
- Bandit's subterfuge fails, dies laughing about "Terrak" who will wipe the floor with heroes
- Alara and Ilizar work together from walls, raining arrows
- Ilizar faces Cassius in melee, bashed by mace
- With Alara's help, takes out Cassius with well-placed dagger
- Ilizar kills Grünner "Fireball" Thorne

**Outcome:**
- Complete victory
- Keep secured
- One bandit captured for questioning

## NPCs Encountered

**Bandits:**
- Cassius - Spokesperson for the thieves (killed by Ilizar)
- Grünner "Fireball" Thorne - Twitchy bandit (killed by Ilizar)
- Tough-looking bandit who mentioned Terrak (killed by Mats)
- One unconscious bandit (captured by Mats)

**Mentioned:**
- Terrak - Mysterious figure the bandits work for
- Alara 'Swiftwind' - Assists in the assault

## Combat Encounters

**Stonebridge Keep Assault:**
- Multiple bandit rogues
- Cassius (leader)
- Grünner "Fireball" Thorne
- Various other bandits
- Victory: Complete party victory, keep secured

## Items Found

- Supplies and goods in the keep (stolen shipments)
- Mining equipment

## Notable Details

- Bandits were nervous about someone named Terrak
- Mining equipment suggests they were looking for something specific
- Weather conditions (fog/mist) aided the assault
- Alara somehow slept through previous combat but was ready for this fight
- One bandit mentions Terrak "will wipe the floor" with the heroes

## Cliffhanger

The keep is secured, but questions remain about Terrak and what the bandits were truly after.

## XP Awards

- Threk - "Hodor" (For running in blind like a boss and soloing the portcullis)
- Ilizar - "Revenge is best served... in your face!" (For taking mace swings to the face and then returning favor by killing Cassius)
- Motiejus - "I am Raiden!" (For summoning electricity and using it to wipe out a handful of rogues)
- Mishko - "Was that how you planned it out in your head?" (For once again having unfortunate dice rolls ruin his clever plan; continuing his really bad, no good, why me?, this isn't fun, is this a d20 or a d10?, streak of only rolling 5s or below)
