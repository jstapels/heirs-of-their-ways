# Session 0 - The Missing Shipments

## Overview

An emergency meeting is called at the Blackthorn Villa to address the growing crisis of missing shipments along the Willrush River. The heads of Loamvale's major houses gather to discuss the problem and assemble an adventuring party to investigate.

## Key Events

### The Emergency Meeting

Montebank Blackthorn calls together the heads of all major houses to address the missing shipment crisis. Large shipments sent down the Willrush River to Rivermeet have been disappearing for the past few months, threatening Loamvale's trade and economy.

### Assembling the Party

Montebank requests that each house volunteer someone for an adventuring party to investigate and resolve the situation. He excuses the Blackthorns from providing a member, instead offering Alara 'Swiftwind', a skilled hunter, to join the expedition.

### Planning the Journey

The assembled leaders discuss logistics and strategy:
- Travel by land along the river (rather than by water) to avoid vulnerability
- Meet at the southeast gate of Loam Borough at sunrise, two days hence
- The Hunters are unable to assist due to commitments in the north at Xorketh and Arrowcross

## NPCs Encountered

**At the Meeting (in order of appearance):**
- Montebank Blackthorn - Head of the Blackthorn Estate, host of the meeting
- Alejandro Escrinos - Head of House Escrinos
- Josep Wolansk - Head of House Wolansk
- Brahm Yrjan Torvaldr - Head of House Torvaldr
- Aldric Stormwind - Head of the Hunters
- Tona Shadowtusk - Head of House Shadowtusk

**Mentioned:**
- Alara 'Swiftwind' - Half-elf hunter volunteered for the expedition
- Mishko Wolansk - Josep's son, described as a "soft boy" who isn't interested in brewing

## Notable Details

- The Hunters are preoccupied with events to the north in Xorketh, helping Arrowcross keep the northern border safe
- Aldric reminds everyone that the Hunters are technically only responsible for the safety of the city or hunting down known criminals
- Josep hopes this adventure will make his son Mishko a "hard man"
- After the formal business concludes, Montebank offers wine and hospitality for continued discussion

## Next Steps

The party is set to meet at the southeast gate of Loam Borough at sunrise in two days to begin their investigation into the missing shipments.
