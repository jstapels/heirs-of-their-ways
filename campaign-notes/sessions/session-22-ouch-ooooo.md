# Session 22 - Ouch-ooooo

## Key Events

The party's tense journey through Baba Yaga's Hut reached its climax in a whirlwind of danger, puzzles, and heart-wrenching choices.

### Specters, Slime, and Spectral Friends

The group continued their battle in the haunted kennels, where specters and a restless blink dog pushed the heroes to their limits:
- **Mats**, despite his usual restraint, struck down the blink dog with a brutal final blow, earning himself a mix of guilt and resignation
- **Threk's radiant smites** and **Ilizar's deadly precision** gradually thinned the ghostly threats
- **Mishko**, ever the charming bard, tried (and failed) to soothe the enraged creatures with words

After the battle, the party met **Elise**, the young ghost they had freed earlier. Her gentle but sorrowful presence followed them as they pushed deeper into the hut. She whispered to Mishko about a second magical collar, which he retrieved, unknowingly binding himself to a **teleportation collar that thrums with strange energy**.

### Cubes, Cauldrons, and Caustic Goo

The group found themselves in a churning acid chamber, full of grates and glowing green vats:
- **Ilizar's curiosity nearly cost him his life** as he triggered a gelatinous cube, barely avoiding being sucked in
- **Mishko's quick thinking**—casting Water Walk so the party could stroll across acid pools—helped them maneuver
- **Threk got engulfed (again)** and had to carve his way out with sheer radiant force

After defeating the cubes, the group recovered a **vial of caustic ooze** and a **potion of Hill Giant Strength** from the acidic remains.

### The Hammer's Deadly Dance

The true prize awaited in a massive chamber where **Builder's Grace**, the legendary hammer, floated within crackling rose-colored lightning:
- **Ilizar misread the pattern twice, getting painfully zapped**
- **Threk's brute-force attempt nearly cooked him alive**
- It was **Mishko's bardic intuition**—treating the electrical pulses like a song—that unlocked the secret rhythm

Playing along, Mishko gave Ilizar the timing he needed, and with a deft sleight of hand, **Ilizar finally claimed the hammer**.

### The Potion of Chaos & the Awakening of Vasilka

With the hammer in hand, the party hurried to complete **Zzyzx's bizarre potion**, tossing in the collected ingredients in the proper order... mostly. The cauldron erupted with **wild magical effects**—levitation, bursts of laughter-inducing spores, and reality-bending illusions. Their final ingredient triggered the reawakening of **Vasilka**, the doll-like creation bound by Baba Yaga's magic.

The ensuing fight was brutal:
- **Threk held the line**, taking blow after blow
- **Ilizar's radiant arrows tore into her**
- **Mats alternated between thunderous strikes and desperately staying alive**
- **Mishko's words slowly reached Elise**, who confessed she could never leave unless released from Baba Yaga's binding

### A Hard Goodbye

In a bittersweet moment, **Mishko promised to give Elise peace**, and with a whispered apology, he released her spirit with a well-aimed Starry Wisp. Her body glowed bright white before vanishing, leaving behind a single **Remove Curse gem**—a final gift from the grateful ghost.

But victory was short-lived. The hut shook violently, and from the shadows **Baba Yaga herself materialized**, ancient and terrifying. Her arrival froze the party in fear.

### The Sneeze Heard 'Round the Hut

Before Baba Yaga could exact vengeance, **Zzyzx the imp** swooped in, shouting for them to follow. As black smoke filled the hut and Baba Yaga unleashed a fireball, the imp triggered the escape plan. The potion's chaotic magic, now complete, activated violently, and the entire hut **sneezed**—literally.

The party was hurled through the halls, sucked into the summoning circle, and flung out of the hut in a violent magical sneeze. They landed outside on soft grass just in time to see Baba Yaga's Hut shimmer and vanish into the Feywild, leaving only silence.
