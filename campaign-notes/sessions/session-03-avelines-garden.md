# Session 3 - Aveline's Garden

## Overview

The party scouts the bandit keep but decides to return Cornelius's cursed rose first. They discover an ancient, lost settlement and encounter the ghost of Aveline Rosewood, leading to a brutal battle with her overgrown garden.

## Key Events

### Scouting the Keep

The party splits into three groups to gather information:

**Threk's Group:**
- Remains behind, examines the strange rose

**Mishko's Group:**
- Swims up the river to investigate the south side
- Discovers another entrance accessible only via bridge
- Bridge appears unmanned but would leave the group vulnerable

**Alara and Ilizar's Group:**
- Circles to the north side
- Finds an open, unguarded entrance
- Discovers an active path heading north

**Decision:**
- Wait until nightfall to approach
- This leaves considerable time
- Threk suggests finding the graveyard to return the rose
- After discussion, group agrees (Ilizar worried about delays and supplies)

### Journey to the Graveyard

- Leave Alara behind to watch the fort
- Follow the trail left by the undead deep into the woods
- After several hours, discover remains of an old, lost settlement
- Find an overgrown graveyard covered in rosebushes

### Encounter with Aveline's Ghost

**Initial Meeting:**
- See more undead and the incorporeal visage of a young half-elf woman
- Ghost appears very upset and angry
- Mishko plays a somber love-tune on his viol (old sailor song from the east)
- Music triggers a memory, calming Aveline's rage

**Conversation:**
- Aveline beckons Threk to approach
- Threk explains he wishes to restore balance and return the rose
- Returns the rose to Aveline Rosewood's grave
- Remaining undead lay down and become lifeless again
- Aveline shares her tragic story

**Aveline's Story:**
- Half-elf woman who lived centuries ago in a village where Silentsong Forest now stands
- Renowned for kindness and beauty, tended a magnificent rose garden with healing properties
- Fell in love with traveling bard named Thorian, who promised to return and marry her
- Thorian perished in a distant land, unknown to Aveline
- She continued tending her roses, waiting for his return
- Ventured into woods one night searching for a rare bloom, caught in a storm
- Succumbed to the elements while clutching a single rose
- Villagers buried her in her garden, placing roses daily on her grave
- Village was eventually abandoned and reclaimed by forest
- Aveline's spirit lingered, bound by unfulfilled longing

**The Request:**
- Aveline asks if the party would help put the villagers' spirits to rest by "taming" her rose garden
- Mishko immediately says "yes, he will do it" (speaking for Threk)

### Battle with the Garden

Aveline disappears and the ground shakes as her garden comes alive:

**Enemies:**
- Massive tangle of vines, bushes, and roses
- Multiple smaller rose and thornbush creatures
- Three massive rose buds burst from Aveline's grave

**Battle Highlights:**
- Mot and Mishko focus on smaller plant creatures
- Threk takes on all three massive roses alone
- Ilizar darts between graves, shooting arrows
- Threk uses inspiration to avoid being drawn to plants
- Mishko uses mirror images to avoid being thorned
- Ilizar's attempts to hide fail (plants sense him), resorts to shield spell
- Threk is eventually eaten by a rose monster
- Mishko becomes tangled in brambles
- Mot is also eaten by a massive rose
- Threk and Mot become unconscious and are spit out
- Mishko and Ilizar use potions and healing word to revive allies
- Mishko drops from a thorn slinger's attack
- Ilizar becomes lunch for a hungry bud
- Mishko wills himself back to consciousness through determination
- Mot dodges bites and drops one of the massive roses
- Mot and Mishko fight back-to-back, finishing smaller plants
- Threk and Ilizar drop the remaining rose buds

**Victory:**
- Battle is barely won with many expended resources
- Aveline reappears and thanks the group
- Gifts them a twisted wand of roots
- A unique ring falls to the ground as Aveline disappears, now at peace
- Threk claims both the wand and the ring
