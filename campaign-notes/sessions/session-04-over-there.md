# Session 4 - Over There!

## Overview

The party returns to Alara, inspects their new magical items, and encounters a group of goblins. An attempt at diplomacy leads to a tense standoff, complicated by Ilizar's distracting illusion. The group eventually retreats and prepares to infiltrate the bandit keep.

## XP Awards

- Ilizar - "Get 'Over there!'" (For scaring and convincing the goblins of allies that never existed)
- Motiejus - "Master of his surroundings" (For using the terrain to his advantage, although it didn't come into play)
- Mishko - "The enemy of my enemy, might still be my enemy?" (For valiantly trying, mostly failing, but kind of eventually succeeding to convince the goblins they are friends)
- Threk - "Are you thirsty?" (For rushing to Ilizar's aid during a nightmare and dumping an entire gallon of swamp water on him to wake him up)
