# Session 20 - Dreams, Deals, and Deadly Dolls

## Key Events

### Into the Hut of Chicken Legs

Having crossed into Baba Yaga's mysterious hut after solving the "stew" riddle, the party found themselves in a strange, shifting cottage brimming with arcane energy and impossible architecture. Greeted by the impish and sly Zzyzx—Baba Yaga's not-quite-loyal doorkeeper—they quickly learned escape would require wit, negotiation, and a little bit of soul-bargaining.

### A Bargain for Escape

Zzyzx, smelling opportunity, offered a way out: a magical recipe, a list of rare ingredients, and the use of Baba Yaga's cauldron. In exchange, he demanded a favor from the party, ultimately binding Ilizar (and only Ilizar, thanks to his intervention) to his debt. With the pact sealed, Zzyzx revealed the only way to escape was to gather the ingredients, brew the potion, and survive the hut's trials—preferably without drawing Baba's wrath.

### Dolls With Purpose

The first room proved harrowing: a workshop filled with disturbingly lifelike dolls, sigil-marked tables, and the oppressive sense of being watched. Through failed and successful skill checks, the group discovered that only by issuing the right command to the "master" doll could they obtain a Spool of Heart Threads—one of their recipe's ingredients. Mats delivered the command, and, in true nightmare fashion, the doll ripped the spool from its own chest.

### A Garden of Trickery and Nectar

The next chamber was a mossy, fairy-lit glade, home to pixies and enchanted butterflies. Threk's keen eyes (and a natural 20) led him to glowing, dripping stones—nectar that could only be collected in a magical vial. Through clever persuasion and Mishko's enchanting performance, the pixies handed over the key to a sarcophagus containing the precious Vial of Luminous Nectar.

### Swamp Kings and Teeth

Venturing further, the party encountered a dank swamp room and a massive, cunning crocodile. After a tense, bizarre negotiation and an ill-fated offer to "climb inside" the beast's mouth, combat broke out. Mats (with an assist from the others) slew the Swamp King, and Threk harvested a Swamp King's Tooth—yet another ingredient for their magical escape.

### Flower Pollen and Family Nightmares

Finally, a pollen-choked chamber of living flowers and intoxicating scents turned out to be the most dangerous yet. Each hero was plunged into a vivid, personal nightmare:
- **Mishko's** family brewery corrupted and drowning in black ale
- **Mats** haunted by whiskey-soaked ancestors
- **Threk** beset by honeybound ghosts
- **Ilizar** tormented by a dying orchard and family shame

The psychic assault was real—only through clever roleplaying and successive saving throws did each character break free, battered but alive.

## Cliffhanger

Their minds reeling, health depleted, and confusion swirling, the party confronted a lurking Myconid and its spores—just as the session ended. With three ingredients secured and several more to go, Baba Yaga's hut remains a maze of riddles, threats, and twisted dreams.
