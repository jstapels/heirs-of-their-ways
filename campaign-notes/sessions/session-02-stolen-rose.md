# Session 2 - The Stolen Rose

**Date:** Lunarday, Windrise 26th, 1602YB

## Overview

The party's journey becomes more difficult as the forest thickens, and they encounter a strange Fey creature, followed by an undead assault at night. They discover an old keep that appears to be occupied by bandits.

## Key Events

### Encounter with Cornelius

The path along the river becomes difficult, forcing the party inland into dense forest.

- Threk tramples through heavy foliage while others sneak ahead
- A strange hairy-armed and legged Fey creature named Cornelius appears behind Threk
- Cornelius requests help returning a pretty rose he stole from an old cemetery
- Ilizar warns Threk that the creature isn't what he seems
- Threk refuses, citing their important mission
- Cornelius attempts to place the rose in Threk's satchel anyway
- The rose is ultimately placed in Threk's pack using Ilizar's mage hand
- Cornelius disappears into the forest

### Night Attack - The Undead

During Mishko's watch that evening, he hears creatures trampling through the forest.

**Battle Details:**
- Mishko casts mirror image, which protects him from initial arrow volleys
- Combination of zombies and skeletons attack
- Skeletons hang back in darkness, making them difficult targets
- Ilizar casts light on himself and runs around shooting enemies as they become visible
- Mot, enlarged by Mishko, deflects many attacks with his monk training
- Threk holds the rose aloft, drawing attacks (which don't harm him much)
- Mishko's kicks prove especially effective against skeletons
- Mot and Mishko finish the remaining skeletons back-to-back

**Aftermath:**
- Alara is shocked to discover she slept through the entire combat
- Threk decides to keep the rose in his pack rather than dispose of it
- The group surmises they're close to the graveyard
- Mot and Mishko joke about having "defeated all the undead in the world"

### Discovery of the Keep

Shortly after breaking camp, the group hears Alara's Hunter whistle.

- Alara reports an old keep ahead, apparently manned by bandits
- This is likely the group capturing the shipments
- She asks the group how they want to approach the situation

## NPCs Encountered

- Cornelius - A strange Fey creature (Pombero) seeking help with a cursed rose
- Alara 'Swiftwind' - Scouts ahead and discovers the keep

## Combat Encounters

**Undead Assault:**
- Multiple zombies
- Multiple skeletal archers
- Victory: Party victory, all undead destroyed

## Items Found

- Cursed rose from an old cemetery (now in Threk's possession)

## Notable Details

- The rose appears to be cursed, attracting undead
- Threk seems unwilling to part with the rose
- The keep ahead likely holds the bandits responsible for the missing shipments
- Group debates whether to investigate the graveyard or focus on their mission
