# Session 15 - The Road to Briar Hollow

## Key Events

With their innocence declared but their duty assigned, the party prepared to leave Loamvale for Briar Hollow. They were tasked with uncovering the cause of the dying farmlands and any lingering connections to Lucien Darkwood.

### Preparations in Loamvale

Before departing, the party sought out Alara, who provided information about Briar Hollow—a dwindling village once controlled by the Darkwood family, now home to only a handful of struggling farmers.

Alara also revealed a stunning revelation: Selene, the mysterious woman they encountered, was likely Sylvaine Willowbrook, Seraphine's twin sister. This explained their tense confrontation in the alleyway. Alara was shocked to learn that her sister was back in town and had been seen speaking of Varrick.

Next, the group tracked down Rogar Stonefist, who had taken part in the Hunter expedition to the Towering Woods. Though dismissive, he let slip that one of the Hunter squads encountered large, monstrous beasts—possibly werewolves—before "driving them off." The party began to suspect that whatever happened in the Towering Woods might have spilled into Briar Hollow, contributing to the region's unnatural decay.

### Leaving Loamvale & The Crossroads Camp

With supplies gathered and a new ally—Brundy Tallaxe, a battle-worn warrior seeking work as a bodyguard—the party set out on the day-and-a-half journey to Briar Hollow. As they left noble lands, the countryside became less cultivated, with signs of failing crops hinting at the land's unnatural withering.

As dusk fell, the party spotted a campfire ahead at a crossroads, where they found an unusual group of travelers:

- **Vesmir** - A charismatic Eladrin storyteller, reclining like a prince of the road
- **A boisterous Satyr** - Playful and mischievous
- **A tiny, fast-moving sprite** - Darting about like a flickering flame
- **Nyx** - A quiet, robed Darkling, his voice carrying an eerie echo
- **A small creature** - Moving so fast it was hard to keep an eye on

The travelers welcomed them warmly, offering wine and stories. But their presence at the crossroads seemed strangely significant—as if fate had drawn them here for a reason.
