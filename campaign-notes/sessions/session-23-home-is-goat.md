# Session 23 - "Home Is Where the Goat Is"

## Key Events

The adventurers escaped from Baba Yaga's hut, hammer intact. They recovered and headed back to Wulfric's Barn.

### Time Went On, But Mr. Tipdip Remains

When the party staggered back out of the witch-road, their most unlikely companion stole the scene: **Mr. Tipdip**, the black-and-white goat, hacked, gagged... and produced treasure:
- First came a **potion of greater healing**, glistening and perfectly sealed
- Later he coughed up a lurid **potion of acid**—as if his belly were some bottomless pantry of oddities

The crew, grimy but grinning, took the hint: this goat was special, and probably hungry.

The world had hurried on without them. Fields told the tale—overgrown rows, weathered posts, a sun that felt wrong in the sky. By smell and sprout and season, the group reckoned **over a month** had slipped by since they'd vanished into the hut's domain. Time, it seemed, was another thing the witch had stolen.

### The Bastion Has Been Built

Back at **Briar Hollow**, Edric Stonebeard and his crew finished their miracle: Wulfric's rough barn had become a warm-boned tavern. Edric set a tiny **hammer-headed nail** and asked the founders to take their places:
- **North** to swear **warmth** (Threk)
- **East** to swear **welcome** (Mats)
- **West** to swear **watch** (Ilizar)
- **South** to swear **joy** (Mishko)

Three measured strikes of **Builder's Grace** rang through timber and floor; lamplight kindled of its own accord, the boards eased like a house taking its first breath, and Edric pronounced the place ready: "Treat it kind and it'll stand storms... treat it cruel and it will remember."

Only one thing remained: a **name**. After some goat-themed banter and a nod to Tipdip's mysteriously **bottomless gut**, they stepped beneath the blank sign and spoke the words. Letters **carved themselves** in living wood—**The Bottomless Goat**—and the tavern was theirs in truth.

### Planting the Magical Sapling

They made the place theirs in deed as well as name. In the yard, the party **planted the magical sapling** that grew from the acorn they got from the living tree:
- Threk dug out a resting place
- The group sluiced it with the **Decanter of Endless Water**
- They tipped in a measure of **healing potion** to seal the pact

The ground drank; the sapling steadied.

### Lord Varrick Visits

Night fell heavy. They **locked the doors** and doused the lamps. The crickets went silent; **shadows pooled** like ink under benches; the front latch **lifted without a hand**.

A soft voice slipped in with the cold: **"You may call me Varrick."**

The man moved like a gravity for darkness, and his words were all velvet and edges. Founders had aims, he said; aims required **coin, quiet, and—most of all—time**.

Then the offer: prove yourselves by retrieving an **Aether Orb** from an **old watermill** off the **Windmill Common Road**, north of town. Do well, and he'd "bring you into his fold." The implication of protection—and the threat beneath it—were both plain.

Not everyone heard the same music in Varrick's tune:
- **Mats** played along with a polite yes
- **Mishko** stayed unreadable
- **Threk** admitted a wary **ambivalence** about handing such power to anyone
- **Ilizar's disgust** was impossible to miss

Varrick marked the **dissension** with a thin smile, then let the **shadows trail him back out** the door. The latch fell shut as quietly as it had risen.

## NPCs Encountered

- **Edric Stonebeard** - Craftsman who completed the tavern construction
- **Lord Varrick** - Shadowy figure who offered a task in exchange for bringing the party into his fold

## Items Found

- **Potion of greater healing** - Produced by Mr. Tipdip
- **Potion of acid** - Produced by Mr. Tipdip
- **The Bottomless Goat** - Newly christened tavern (formerly Wulfric's barn)

## Important Notes

- Over a month passed while the party was in Baba Yaga's hut
- The Bottomless Goat was formally established as a Bastion with the four founders swearing oaths
- Magical sapling planted in the yard
- Varrick's offer to retrieve an Aether Orb from the old watermill
- Party is divided on whether to trust Varrick

## Session Conclusion

The founders of The Bottomless Goat sat with the crackle of the hearth and the hush of a house listening. They had a home to keep, a sapling to raise, and a shadow-lord's task to weigh. For the first time in a long while, the road could wait until morning.
