# Session 8 - Don't Meph' with Me

## Overview

The party interrogates Mara Stonefist, ultimately killing her when her cooperation fails. They explore deeper into the cave system, discovering a mysterious elemental fountain and encountering more mephits before hearing voices from below.

## Key Events

### Interrogating Mara

Mara isn't forthcoming with details:

**Information Extracted:**
- Was hired for a job
- Stealing shipments at the fort was a backup plan
- When asked about Terrak, she clams up
- Mats threatens to kill her if she doesn't talk
- Agrees to tell them anything if they promise to let her go
- Mats agrees to the deal

**Details Learned:**
- Mara and crew were hired to mine (didn't know what they were looking for)
- Terrak and his associate constantly oversaw the operation
- Mara didn't know the associate, always dealt with Terrak
- Managed to catch that the associate's name was Selene
- When asked when Terrak and Selene would return: "she never saw them leave"

**Threk's Discovery:**
- Finds a hole with ladder underneath a rug
- Ladder goes much farther down

**Mara's Death:**
- Group asks about the hole
- Mara responds sarcastically: "care to explain what a hole in the ground is?"
- Group punches Mara in face
- She taunts: "what's the matter, you don't like my answer?"
- Ilizar, fed up with snarky answers, slits her throat

### Investigation and Rest

- Group investigates area and bodies
- Takes a long rest
- Finds items on Mara and bandits

### Deeper into the Caves

Party descends ladder and explores:

**Mephit Battle:**
- Comes across group of mud and dust mephits
- Methodically destroys them

**The Elemental Fountain:**
- Strange area with old fountain
- Four stone slabs around fountain representing four base elements:
  - Fire
  - Earth
  - Air
  - Water
- Party experiments with adding elements to basin
- Must have picked wrong order
- Elements retaliate, causing damage
- Decide to investigate later

**Descending Further:**
- Continues and finds stairs going deeper
- Heads downward
- Hears voices of gruff male and lithe female
- Possibly Terrak and Selene?

**Note to Mara Stonefist:**

> To Mara Stonefist,
>
> You and your friends' efforts in disrupting the shipments from Loamvale are commendable. The chaos you've sown is already yielding results. Continue to block the river passage and ensure no goods reach Rivermeet. Your reward will be substantial once our objectives are met.
>
> Remember, secrecy is paramount. Do not fail me.
>
> — L.D.

## Notable Details

- Mara's sarcasm led to her death
- The note is signed by "L.D." (possibly Lucien Darkwood?)
- Terrak and Selene are overseeing a mining operation
- They're looking for something specific (likely related to elemental magic)
- The elemental fountain is a puzzle that needs solving
- Mephits suggest strong elemental presence in the caves
- The operation is part of disrupting Loamvale's shipments

## Cliffhanger

The party hears voices from deeper in the caves - likely Terrak and Selene. What are they doing down here?
