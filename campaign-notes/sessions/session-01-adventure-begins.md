### The Party Assembles

The five adventurers meet at the southeast gate in the morning:

**First to arrive:**
- Threk Shadowtusk - A massive loxodon in chainmail with a large shield bearing Shyhad's symbol

**Next to arrive:**
- Alara 'Swiftwind' - Female half-elf with silver hair in Hunter gear, equipped with elven cloak, longbow, and shortsword

**From the river:**
- Mishko Wolansk - A green-haired young triton in an earthy brown three-piece suit (sans jacket), immediately lights a cigar

**Last to arrive (much later):**
- Ilizar Escrinos - A disheveled young human with a nonchalant attitude

### The Journey Begins

- Alara distributes Hunter's Whistles to each party member for emergencies
