# The Feywild and Its History

The Feywild's collision with Mikill Fyrir is a defining event in the world's history, leaving lasting impacts on the region.

## The Collision

In ancient times, a catastrophic merging occurred between the Feywild and Mikill Fyrir. This event:
- Scattered elemental forces across both planes
- Unraveled the natural order
- Scattered the Feywild's guardians across both planes
- Left pockets of Feywild energy throughout the Material Plane

## Survivors and Remnants

### Luminara
An archfey who made the fateful decision to remain behind during the collision, binding herself to a sanctuary grotto to protect its delicate balance. She has remained there for centuries, waiting for those who would help maintain harmony.

### Altharion Whisperthorn
A half-elf protector of the Feywild who refused to abandon Luminara. He stood as silent sentinel of the grotto for centuries before eventually succumbing to elemental instability. His body remains near the sanctuary entrance, and his blade **Whisperthorn** now belongs to Ilizar.

### Cornelius
A Pombero (satyr-like fey) who survived the merging. According to Luminara, his survival gives hope that other fey managed to survive as well.

### Other Fey Creatures
Various fey creatures were stranded in the Material Plane:
- Pixies (encountered in Baba Yaga's Hut)
- Redcaps (hostile fey near Briar Hollow)
- Quicklings (in Baba Yaga's Hut)
- Vesmir's band (Eladrin, satyr, sprite, darkling)

## The Fey Grotto

Hidden beneath the hills near Loamvale is a sanctuary of tranquil beauty:
- Marble walkway overlooking glowing waterway
- Bioluminescent light casting rippling patterns
- Large lily pads drifting on water
- Intricate gold inlays on marble pillars
- Glowing runes and carvings of vines, flowers, and mythical creatures

The grotto can be accessed through:
- The elemental fountain puzzle (fire, earth, air, water)
- A prayer spoken in Sylvan (readable with Whisperthorn)

## The Elemental Fountain

An ancient mechanism found in the caves:
- Four slabs of stone representing the four base elements
- Can be activated by adding elements in correct order
- Wrong order causes elemental retaliation
- Correct activation reveals hidden passages

## Aether Orbs

See [aether-orbs.md](aether-orbs.md) for detailed information.

The orbs were Feywild artifacts scattered during the collision, now sought by multiple factions.

## Baba Yaga's Hut

A legendary structure that walks on chicken legs, moving between the Feywild and Material Plane:
- Appears during the full moon
- Contains pocket dimensions inside
- Home to Baba Yaga, a powerful hag
- Currently fled back to the Feywild after party's escape

### Inhabitants
- **Baba Yaga** - Ancient, terrifying hag
- **Zzyzx** - Imp bellhop/doorkeeper
- **Vasilka** - Doll-like creation
- **Elise** - Ghost child (now freed)

## Fey Courts

### Winter Court
Located in North Veterlands. The storyteller Alderis Windchime recently visited there and met noble figures of the court.

### Other Courts
Details unknown, but the traditional Summer, Spring, and Autumn courts likely exist.

## Impact on Modern Day

The Feywild collision continues to affect the region:
- Ley lines remain disrupted
- Elemental instabilities persist in some areas
- Fey creatures appear sporadically
- Aether Orbs attract those seeking power
- Veils between realms remain thin in places

Luminara's concern is that someone may tip the scales further, with dire consequences for both planes.
