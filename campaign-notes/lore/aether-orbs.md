# The Aether Orbs

Ancient artifacts of immense power, relics from a time long before the merging of the Feywild with Mikill Fyrir.

## Origins

The Aether Orbs were crafted by powerful archfey at the peak of the **Crystalline Summit**, a mystical place in the Feywild where the raw elemental energies of fire, water, earth, and air converged. Only the most attuned fey artisans and spellweavers could shape these orbs, binding elemental forces into perfect harmony.

## Original Purpose

The orbs were designed as conduits for elemental harmony, maintaining balance across the chaotic landscape of the Feywild by stabilizing its elemental forces.

Originally embedded in key ley lines across the Feywild, they:
- Ensured elemental chaos didn't spiral out of control
- Allowed nature to flourish
- Stabilized ecosystems
- Enhanced the beauty and wonder of the Feywild

They were revered as sacred objects and fiercely protected by the guardians of the fey courts.

## The Collision with Mikill Fyrir

When the Feywild merged with Mikill Fyrir in a catastrophic event, the orbs were scattered across the Material Plane:
- Many were lost to time
- Some buried deep within mountains
- Others hidden in forests
- Some submerged beneath lakes

Their absence left parts of the Feywild in disarray, destabilizing the natural order in the remnants of the merged realms.

## Known Properties

The Aether Orbs are renowned for their ability to:
- **Absorb** massive amounts of elemental energy
- **Store** that energy indefinitely
- **Release** it in controlled or catastrophic ways

When aligned along ley lines, they can amplify natural forces, creating phenomena such as:
- Eternal storms
- Unending geysers
- Floating isles

Each orb is attuned to all four elements, though certain orbs may have subtle biases depending on the environment in which they were placed.

## Corruption and Misuse

Over the centuries, those who stumbled upon the orbs attempted to harness their energy:
- Some sought to create powerful weapons
- Others attempted grand constructions
- Some tried to manipulate nature itself

This misuse often resulted in catastrophe, as the balance within the orbs could not be easily controlled. Some orbs became corrupted, their energies twisted, creating:
- Unnatural phenomena
- Attraction of malevolent entities

## Luminara's Warning

The Archfey Luminara cautioned the party:

> "The Aether Orbs are powerful conduits of elemental energy. They were once used to harmonize the elements, but in the wrong hands, they can sow discord and destruction. There are more like this, scattered across the land. Be wary, for those who seek them do so with purpose—often dark."

She emphasized that even now, the veils between realms thin, and others who hunger for power may seek to tip the scales.

## Known Orbs

### Necrotic Aspect Orb

## Competing Interests

Multiple factions seek the Aether Orbs:

| Faction | Known Interest |
|---------|---------------|
| The Shadow Conspiracy | Active collection, purpose unknown |
| Lord Varrick | Sent party to retrieve one |
| Lucien Darkwood | Funding operations to find them |
| Luminara | Wants them protected and balanced |

## Party's Quest

Luminara asked the adventurers to take up the quest to recover and protect the Aether Orbs, warning them of the dangers ahead.

The party must decide:
- Who to trust with such power
- Whether to keep them, hide them, or destroy them
- How to prevent the Shadow Conspiracy from collecting more
