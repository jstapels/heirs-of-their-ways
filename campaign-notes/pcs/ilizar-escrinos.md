## Description

A young human who often arrives disheveled with a nonchalant attitude. Quick to hit on attractive women and slow to understand the seriousness of situations.

## Family Connection

Youngest and only male heir of the Escrinos family, making him the **unwilling heir apparent** to the Escrinos Estate. His reluctance to accept his title and responsibility has not gone unnoticed.

### Family Dynamics
- **Father Alejandro** - Head of the Escrinos Estate
- **Sister Valentina** - Eldest, capable and driven, runs much of the business. Most people don't understand why she isn't the heir instead.
- **Sister Isabella** - Second child, constantly compared to their late mother
- **Cousin Mateo** - Head of security, often called "Ilizar's Babysitter" for spending so much time tracking Ilizar down

Many resent Ilizar for neither deserving nor wanting the inheritance. The people of Loamvale view him as an aloof, no-good troublemaker.

## Personality

- Impulsive (blew the Hunter's Whistle immediately just to see what would happen)
- Clever in combat but sometimes makes questionable decisions
- Can be ruthless when frustrated
- Has dark moments and nightmares

## Notable Abilities

- Expert at stealth and infiltration
- Skilled with bow and daggers
- Can cast Mage Hand and other utility magic
- Shield spell for emergency defense
- Uses illusions creatively ("Over there!")

## Magic Items

### Whisperthorn
*Enchanted Shortsword*

A shortsword with a silvery-green blade that glows faintly. The hilt is etched with vines and flowers, wrapped in soft green leather. The pommel features a shifting gemstone like a moonlit pond.

**Properties:**
- Grants ability to understand Sylvan
- Additional magical properties

Found in the Fey grotto, this weapon allowed Ilizar to read the ancient runes and speak the prayer that summoned Luminara.

## Campaign Highlights

- Created the "Over there!" distraction illusion that befuddled goblins
- Lit himself up to illuminate camp during the skeleton attack
- Killed Cassius in revenge after being maced in the face
- Executed Grüner "Fireball" Thorne
- Slit Mara Stonefist's throat when she got too snarky
- Successfully climbed walls with Alara to infiltrate Stonebridge Keep
- Read the ancient Sylvan prayer that summoned Luminara

## Troubled Sleep

Ilizar has shown signs of troubled dreams:
- Restless, fitful nights
- At least one nightmare violent enough to require being woken by swamp water to the face
- Unknown connection to deeper troubles

## Current Role

Despite his reluctance about family responsibilities, Ilizar has proven himself capable in the field. He represents the Escrinos Estate in the current mission, though whether this adventure will change his perspective on his duties remains to be seen.
