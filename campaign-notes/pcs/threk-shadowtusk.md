## Description

Threk is a massive Loxodon. While his strength and toughness are evident, so is his clumsiness (nicknamed "Stonefoot"). He wears heavy armor with a sword at his side and a holy symbol of Shyhad on his shield. His tusks are fully white - he has not inherited the coveted darkened tusks of his family's progenitor.

## Personality

### Early Life
Curious and eager, absorbing everything from extended cousins about bees, mead brewing, and sales. Learned arcane arts from cousin Thritun and admired cousin Oa's piety for Eunevia.

### Young Adult
His attention suffered - always one for the moment, moving on when bored. "Living for the moment" was his mantra, masking his true personality behind a drunk, merry persona of the spoiled rich kid. Threk was lost, without purpose, seen as a disappointment.

### Today
Still holds doubt and fear of being a failure, not being remembered. But believes he's found the solution through Shyhad worship. Can still be outgoing and charismatic, loves good stories and songs. Looks for purpose, believes his path is special - chosen by Shyhad for great things.

Takes Shyhad's teachings to heart, looking for order in all things. Dislikes those who take sides between good and evil, believing balance is the only true answer.

- Favorite family member is elder cousin **Tvor**, another family outsider they've bonded with

## Biography

> **Warning:** This character history is not fully known in-character.

### Chapter 1 - The Prodigal Son (1449-1600 YB)

Born in 1449 YB to much rejoicing as first child of popular Matriarch Tona. His pampered early life exposed him to all passions and estate operations. Early signs appeared:
- Stung by bees (nature path unlikely)
- Inherent clumsiness ("Stonefoot")
- Grew tiresome of business, became a rebel

His life became nights of card playing, gambling, drinking, and "sampling the buffet of different females." He traveled to Shadow's End via family trade business, bribing his mother's contacts to send false reports omitting his indiscretions.

### Chapter 2 - The Paladin (1600-1601 YB)

Family moved on, naming Takov presumptive heir. Threk didn't seem to care - he was enjoying life.

**The Ambush (Summer 1600):**
His caravan was attacked by insectoid monsters. Hiding from the fight, he experienced flashes of regret. *What would his legacy be if it ended here?*

**Dane Wyverntooth** and the Ascendency Guild saved him. Instead of going to bars in Shadow's End, Threk went to the Guild House. Nearly a year later, he completed training under Dane, learning Shyhad's dogma of balance - neither purely good nor evil, but harmony.

### Chapter 3 - The Path of Parity (1601-1602 YB)

By Summer 1601, Threk harnessed divine power of Shyhad and her demigod Natalya (redemption). He returned to Loamdale; his change was noticed but few believed it genuine.

**The Woods of the Sages (Summer 1602):**
Threk took an Ascendency retrieval job. Something attacked his company - he fought bravely, not retreating, but was overwhelmed. Fallen and dying, he saw:

*A formless angel appeared. "Arise. Live. Your path is not over."*

A rush of life, a jolt of energy. He revived a surviving Barbarian companion; they retreated to Shadow's End. Threk is certain an avatar of Shyhad saved him and pointed him toward his destiny. He returned home hoping to help his family and earn back their respect.
