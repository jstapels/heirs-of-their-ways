# Coral Veil Adventure Items

Magic items and treasure from the Sunken Village of Coral Veil adventure.

---

## Aether Orb (Water Aspect)
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

> *This fist-sized sphere contains swirling ocean currents in miniature—blues and greens dancing in eternal motion. When held, you can hear distant whale song and feel the pull of tides.*

**Properties (while attuned):**
- You can breathe underwater and have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed
- You have resistance to cold damage
- Once per long rest, you can cast *Control Water* without expending a spell slot

**Orb Resonance:**
You can sense the approximate direction of other Aether Orbs within 1 mile.

**Dual Orb Effect:**
When carried alongside the Necrotic Aether Orb, the bearer occasionally sees visions of death by drowning (necrotic orb) or feels phantom sensations of decay (water orb). These are disturbing but not mechanically harmful—yet.

**Source:** Recovered from the Pearlheart Chamber altar after defeating Veth'sora.

## Trident of Fish Command
*Weapon (trident), rare (requires attunement)*

**Source:** Veth'sora's hoard.

---

## Cloak of the Depths
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

- You have resistance to cold damage
- You can breathe underwater
- While underwater, you have advantage on Stealth checks

**Source:** Veth'sora's hoard.

## Net of Entangling
*Adventuring gear (net), uncommon*

> *This net is woven from enchanted kelp fibers that constrict when they sense struggling.*

**Properties:**
Functions as a net, but the target must succeed on a [[/save STR 13]] saving throw to break free, rather than simply cutting it. The net has AC 12 and 10 HP.

**Source:** Coral Veil armory.

---

## Cloak of the Manta Ray
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

> *A deep blue cloak that transforms into manta-like wings when underwater.*

## Pearl of Power
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

> *A lustrous pearl that pulses with arcane energy.*

**Properties:**
While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once used, the pearl can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Quantity:** 4 gifted by Elder Coralline

**Source:** Village gift.

## Driftglobe
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

> *A small glass sphere containing swirling motes of light.*

**Properties:**
This glass sphere can hover near you. You can use an action to speak one of two command words:
- First command word causes the globe to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet (as the *Light* spell)
- Second command word causes the globe to cast *Daylight* (once per day)

**Source:** Village gift.

## Conch Shell of Underwater Blasting
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

> *A gold-inlaid conch shell that hums with contained energy.*

**Properties:**
Functions as a *Horn of Blasting* but only when the user and all targets are underwater. When used underwater, targets in a 30-foot cone must make a [[/save CON 15]] saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage 5d6 thunder]] damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half damage and isn't deafened.

**Value:** 100 gp (as treasure) or use as magic item

**Source:** Veth'sora's hoard.
