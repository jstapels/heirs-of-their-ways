# Allies & Miscellaneous NPCs

Other notable characters the party has encountered.

## The Hunters

### Alara "Swiftwind"
*Scout & Ranger*

Steady, quick, and candid when the truth stings. The party's first formal contact with The Hunters. Helped map approach to Stonebridge Keep and provided the critical link revealing Selene's identity as Seraphine's twin.

**Status:** Active (ally)

**Secret:** Actually a Willowbrook - younger sister to Seraphine and Sylvaine - but keeps the family name at arm's length to prove she can stand on her own. Has personal reasons she doesn't discuss (redacted information).

**Family Ties:** Longstanding ties to the Willowbrook family through the Lodge. Seraphine mentored her. Treats the Willowbrooks as her own.

**Motivations:**
1. Keep Loamvale safe
2. Keep The Hunters neutral
3. If possible, bring truth to light without forcing blood between the Willowbrook sisters

**Campaign Role:** Accompanied the party on the initial mission. Has tendency to sleep through combat, be shocked by the party's condition after battles, and provide timely support.

## Builders & Craftsmen

### The Hands of Kasprus

**Members:** Edric Stonebeard, Gwyneth, Serena, Wilmar

A dwarven-backed building guild with calloused palms and pride to match.

**Status:** Active (hired allies)

**Member Roles:**
- **Edric Stonebeard** (half-dwarf, foreman) - Wears responsibility like well-fitted apron. Still smarts from losing ancestral warhammer Builder's Grace to a crafty crone.
- **Gwyneth** (human) - Sketches sturdier than stone
- **Serena** (elf) - Wrangles schedules and suppliers
- **Wilmar** (human) - Can sell a hearth to a dragon

**Deal:** Offered to turn Wulfric's worn farm into proper bastion and tavern, discounting work if party recovered Builder's Grace.

**Quest Result:** Led through Baba Yaga's Hut, storm of alchemical chaos, and abrupt awakening of Vasilka before the Hut "sneezed" the group free.

**Services:** Pay their price or complete their favors, and they will raise legends in timber and granite.

## Local Contacts

### Brundy Tallaxe
*Retired Knight*

Retired knight in mid-forties with sturdy build of a man who still trains at dawn. Scars map stories he doesn't brag about. Keeps well-cared-for chain close at hand, more habit than vanity.

**Status:** Active (friendly contact)

**Location:** Steady presence at the practice yard and far end of the bar - short on flattery, long on practical advice.

**Disposition:** Fair-minded ally. Sympathetic about Wulfric's death, approving of decision to fortify the farm, willing to run drills or share old road wisdom about Briar Hollow and Darkwood lands.

**Services:** Won't sign on for glory quests, but for fair price (or good cask) will:
- Connect the group with reliable caravan captains
- Recommend smiths and mercenaries
- Speak plainly about which fights are worth finishing

## Rivals

### Sterlyn
*Bardic Rival*

A peacock in silk and illusions who challenged Mishko to a duel at the Vine & Valor and lost to thunderous applause.

**Status:** Active (antagonistic)

**Grudge:** Bruised ego has not healed. Talent for tavern gossip means wounded pride travels faster than most news sheets.

**Utility:** Both complication and opportunity - a rival who will sling barbs in verse, and a social butterfly whose jealousy may accidentally drop useful rumors about whose purse strings pull which performers in Loamvale.

## Historical NPCs

### The Skeleton in the Grotto

Found in the fey grotto resting against a marble pillar, clutching an ancient satchel containing:
- Healing potions
- A rapier
- **Whisperthorn** (ornate shortsword, now wielded by Ilizar)

Identity unknown - possibly an ancient adventurer who reached the grotto but could not leave.
