**Stats:** Veteran with:
- Swimming speed 40 ft.
- Resistance to psychic damage
- *Command* at will (DC 13)

**Appearance:**
> *She might have been beautiful once—her features echo Thalindra's elegance. But her eyes are filmed with opalescent mucus, and her movements carry an unsettling fluidity, as if something else wears her body like a suit. When she speaks, her voice harmonizes with Veth'sora's psychic emanations in a deeply wrong way.*

**Background:**
Thalindra's mother, Elder Coralline's daughter. Among the first villagers taken by the aboleth. Now serves as its primary lieutenant and "voice," translating psychic commands to verbal orders.

**During Combat (Breaking Through):**
Her true personality occasionally surfaces:

> *"Tell Thalindra... tell her I tried..."*
> *"The dreams... I can't escape the dreams..."*

- **Saved (knocked unconscious):** Can be cured, tearful reunion with family
- **Killed:** Last moment of clarity thanking killer for ending her suffering

**Plot Function:**
- Emotional stakes (Thalindra's mother)
- Lieutenant in boss fight
- Potential for dramatic rescue or tragic death
