# Briar Hollow NPCs

Characters connected to the Briar Hollow settlement and the surrounding Darkwood lands.

## Residents

### Wulfric Hallowbane ☠️
*Farmer*

Grizzled and stubborn sheep farmer at the edge of Briar Hollow who minded his own business - until something began taking his animals in the night. Asked for help straight and died hard when the lycanthropes came.

**Status:** DECEASED

**Legacy:** The party covered his back taxes and claimed the farm, turning tragedy into a foothold.

**Useful Info:** His neighbors remember old stories about the Darkwood lands and the long howl across the fields. A shared drink can loosen those memories.

## The Lycanthrope Pack

A organized pack of were-folk operating near Briar Hollow, led by Vargr Bloodfang. Their attacks feel like a campaign, not a rampage.

### Vargr Bloodfang
*Pack Alpha*

The name the were-folk speak with respect and calculation. The pack's unseen alpha - patient enough to probe and withdraw rather than crash headlong into blades. His forces include various types of lycanthropes organized enough to feel like a campaign.

**Status:** Active (threat)

**Forces:** Wererats, wereboar, wolves, weretiger - all coordinated

**Encounter:** Following Mat's somewhat misguided directions, the party found Vargr's camp in a pine-ringed hollow. Cookfires banked low, bone charms swaying. Vargr stepped onto a mossy stone to parley while lieutenants drifted to flanks.

**Parley Result:** Words sharpened, bows half-drawn. The clearing hung a heartbeat from violence before both sides stood down after "a certain proposal." Vargr let them walk with a promise: the outskirts of Briar Hollow was pack land, and one more step away from the farm would be answered in blood.

### Liora Hren Serin
*Wererat Lieutenant / Mats' Former Love*

Rabbit-swift and steel-nerved, fights like a flicker - there and gone with bruises left behind. Recognized Mats mid-battle, proof of shared past she did not unpack.

**Status:** Active (complicated)

**Notable Action:** Struck Ilizar with a curse that lingers like a bruise under the skin.

**Position:** Among the were-folk she moves with authority of someone who has the alpha's ear.

**Assessment:** Felt conflicted - more soldier than zealot, weighing orders against memories.

**Potential:** If any bridge exists between pack and parley, it may run through Liora - on ground of her choosing and with respect shown.

**Connection to Mats:** This is the same Liora Hren Serin who Mats believed died from beast attacks in the Towering Woods. Her apparent survival and transformation adds complicated layers to their relationship.

---

### Rajan Shadowclaw
*Weretiger Scout*

Moves with predator's patience, circling rather than charging, letting fear do half the work. Tall figure with gold-cat eyes who favors moonless approaches and silent kills.

**Status:** Active (survived farm attack)

**Tactics:** Hunters vanish between hedgerows and reappear where ground is softest. Rarely speaks in a fight, but calls retreat a heartbeat before trap closes.

**Territory Markers:** Pulled back from the farm once pack took losses, marking trees with narrow slashes like crescent moons - territorial warning.

**Assessment:** Among Vargr's lieutenants, reads as quiet professional: loyal to alpha but not eager to waste lives.

---

### Kael Darkfang
*Werewolf Strategist*

Carries command like a cloak: low voice, sharp scenting, habit of assigning lanes and flanks before anyone else finishes arguing. Coordinated first encirclement during farm assault.

**Status:** Active (survived farm attack)

**Tactics:** Favors dusk when shadows stretch and mistakes multiply. Testing weak points with quick feints and hard retreats.

**Current Activity:** Since the battle, seen only at distance - glassing the homestead from tree line, counting heads.

**Assessment:** If Vargr has a battlefield strategist, Kael is it. Less about glory, more about leverage - most likely to probe party's routines for a crack.

---

### Skar Bloodhowl
*Werewolf Berserker*

The pack's hammer: broad-shouldered, scar-crossed, built to break doors and wills. Voice flips from gravel laugh to carrying, unnerving howl that rattles livestock and loose shutters.

**Status:** Active (survived farm attack)

**Farm Attack:** Pressed the heaviest push, shrugging off wounds that would drop lesser foes before falling back with promise to return.

**Current Activity:** Lingers near old sheep paths after midnight, daring sentries to come too far from lantern light.

**Assessment:** Expect him to lead any revenge strike that values shock over subtlety - teeth first, questions after.

---

## Pack Losses

Most of the pack fell at Wulfric's farm during the party's defense. The survivors (Vargr, Liora, Rajan, Kael, Skar) represent the remaining core of the threat.

---

## The Farm / Bastion

**Wulfric's Farm** has been claimed by the party after his death. They've:
- Covered his back taxes
- Hired the Hands of Kasprus to fortify it into a proper bastion
- Plan to convert it into both a defensive position and potential tavern

The farm sits at the contested edge of Briar Hollow, with pack territory looming close.
