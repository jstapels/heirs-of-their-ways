## Notable Personages

### Alejandro Escrinos
*Head of the Escrinos Family*

The patriarch and head of the Escrinos Estate.

### Valentina Escrinos
*Eldest Daughter*

Ever since she was little, Valentina followed her father everywhere and was interested in everything he did. Though quite young when her mother passed away, she was aware of her father's pain, and the two grieved together.

As she grew, she learned more of the family's business operations and eventually took over many responsibilities from her father. She is well respected by the people of Loamvale - seen as capable, reliable, and driven.

Most people do not understand why Ilizar, who seems to be the opposite of Valentina, is the heir apparent and not her.

### Isabella Escrinos
*Second Daughter*

Less than two years old when her mother passed away, Isabella doesn't remember her at all. Everything she knows comes from her older sister and the townspeople, who constantly tell her she is the spitting image of her mother, blessed with her beauty and grace.

The comparisons to a mother she never knew weigh heavily on her, creating pressure to live up to lofty expectations. She doesn't know the business as well as Valentina, and her father gives her little guidance or responsibility. She tries her best, throwing dinner parties to win favor with business associates and her father.

### Ilizar Escrinos
*Youngest Child & Heir Apparent*

The youngest and only male heir of the Escrinos family. He is the **unwilling heir apparent** to the Escrinos Estate. This unwillingness has not gone unnoticed - many resent him for neither deserving the inheritance nor wanting it.

Many people view Ilizar as an aloof, no-good troublemaker.

### Mateo Escrinos
*Head of Security*

Nephew of Alejandro Escrinos. Proud of his heritage and position, Mateo takes pride in protecting his family and their estate. Unfortunately, much of his time is spent tracking down Ilizar and bringing him home.

As a result, he is often jokingly referred to as "Ilizar's Babysitter" by the townspeople.

## Connection to Player Characters

Ilizar Escrinos is a member of this family, though his role is complicated by his reluctance to accept his responsibilities as heir. His sisters Valentina (capable and respected) and Isabella (trying to prove herself) represent different aspects of the family's future.
