## Family History

**Brahm Yrjan Torvaldr**, an avid scholar and inventor, mastered distilling various liquids and eventually refined the recipe called Tun Languor. His partner, **Hretna Asgier Lovik**, came from prestige and acquired resources to assist his endeavors.

When the Asgiers discovered Hretna was associating with a Yrjan, she was outcast due to perceived shame. This only reinforced her desire to see Brahm succeed. She employed her natural affinity for commerce to market Brahm's alcohol products.

## Family Traits

Torvaldr individuals primarily fall into three categories, with extremely rare exceptions. An unspoken rule treats those who stray from these paths as pariahs:

**Inventors** - Create alcohol distilleries and warehousing with advanced machinery to reduce manual workload throughout the production process.

**Scholars** - Focus on education - teachers, writers, record keepers, and philosophers.

**Farmers** - Taught agricultural theory by scholars, well-versed in whiskey production crops and general food supplies.
