### The Marrow Titan
*Final Boss*
When Malrik fell, the Aether Orb animated the surrounding bones:
- Bones tore free from every pile
- Spiraled into a storm
- Ribs knit into colossal plates
- Vertebrae stacked like mill gears
- Horned skull locked into place
- Orb seated as glowing heart
- Surrounded by scything cyclone of bone

- How did Varrick know the party would investigate?
- Are there other sites like this in the region?
- What will be the consequences of taking the orb?
