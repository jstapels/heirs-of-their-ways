# Blackthorn Estate

The Blackthorn Estate is a greater household in the Loamvale region, known throughout the land for their exceptional red wine. The Blackthorns are also responsible for overseeing The Hunters organization.

## Crest
The Blackthorn family crest features their distinctive imagery representing their monster-hunting heritage and winemaking mastery.

## Family History

The Blackthorn name traces back to Monte Blackthorn, who amassed a small fortune hunting dangerous monsters like vampires and werewolves. Upon retirement, he bought land in Loamvale and began growing grapes as a hobby.

Monte married a half-elf named Swanne Melrose, who loved the lavish lifestyle and threw extravagant parties. These parties, which always featured Blackthorn wine, brought the wine to public attention. Despite constant urging, Monte refused to sell commercially, creating an almost legendary status for the wine.

After Monte's death, his eldest son Montefils inherited the estate and the winemaking secrets. Having a natural talent for alchemy, Montefils expanded production and built the estate into a premier wine label, exporting throughout Aevir.

The current head is **Montebank Blackthorn**, who has held the "wine master" title for decades. His exact age is unknown, fueling rumors about the family's unusually long lives, attributed to their half-elf heritage.

## Wine Making

The Blackthorn winemaking process is meticulously guarded:

1. **Grape Selection:** Goldenroot grapes, a varietal unique to Loamvale
2. **Harvest:** Handpicked at the peak of ripeness under the waning harvest moon
3. **Crushing:** Gentle method to ensure proper tannin balance
4. **Fermentation:** In aged oak barrels in vast cellars beneath the estate
5. **Aging:** Rigorous regime of racking and testing
6. **Final Product:** Nuanced undertones of vanilla and spice from oak barrels
