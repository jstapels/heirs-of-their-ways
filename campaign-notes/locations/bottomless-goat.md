# The Bottomless Goat

*Party Bastion / Tavern in Briar Hollow*

The party's home base, established on the grounds of Wulfric Hallowbane's former sheep farm after his death at the hands of lycanthropes.

## History

### Wulfric's Farm
Originally a modest sheep barn owned by Wulfric Hallowbane, a gruff farmer at the edge of Briar Hollow. Wulfric was killed by Brannor's lycanthrope pack during an attack on his property.

### Acquisition
After Wulfric's death, the party:
- Buried him with respect
- Paid his substantial back taxes to Mina Gainswell (tax assessor for House Escrinos)
- Became the legal owners of the property

### Construction
The Hands of Kasprus (Edric Stonebeard's building guild) transformed the property into a proper tavern and bastion in exchange for recovering **Builder's Grace**, Edric's ancestral hammer, from Baba Yaga's Hut.

## The Dedication Ceremony

Four founders took positions at the cardinal directions to anchor the warding oath:
- **North (Warmth):** Threk
- **East (Welcome):** Mats
- **West (Watch):** Ilizar
- **South (Joy):** Mishko

Three measured strikes of Builder's Grace rang through timber and floor. Lamplight kindled of its own accord, and Edric pronounced: "Treat it kind and it'll stand storms... treat it cruel and it will remember."

## The Naming

After considering various names (including goat-themed options in honor of Mr. Tip-Dip), the founders stood beneath the blank sign and spoke the words. Letters carved themselves in living wood: **The Bottomless Goat**.

### The Magical Sapling
In the yard, the party planted the sapling grown from the **World Seed Acorn** obtained from Baba Yaga's Hut:
- Threk dug the resting place
- Watered with the Decanter of Endless Water
- Blessed with a measure of healing potion
- The ground accepted it; the sapling steadied

## Location

Near the market run in Briar Hollow, within earshot of the well. Strategically positioned for:
- Establishing roots in the community
- Earning local trust
- Serving as a base of operations

## Notable Visitors

### Lord Varrick
The shadow lord visited the Bottomless Goat at night shortly after its establishment:
- Doors locked; he entered anyway
- Shadows pooled like ink beneath benches
- Offered a deal: retrieve an Aether Orb from an old watermill in exchange for his "protection"
- The party's reactions were mixed:
  - Mats played along politely
  - Mishko stayed unreadable
  - Threk showed wary ambivalence
  - Ilizar's disgust was plain
- Varrick departed through the shadows, leaving the party to consider his offer

## Staff

Currently the party manages the establishment themselves. Future staff TBD.
