      <p>This elegant longsword gleams with an inner radiance, as if forged from
      captured sunlight. The blade is etched with ancient runes that glow faintly
      in darkness.</p>
      <p><strong>Radiant Strike:</strong> Once per day, you can channel the blade's
      power to make a devastating attack. On a hit, the target takes an extra

      until the end of your next turn.</p>
      <p><strong>Light:</strong> The blade can emit bright light in a 20-foot radius
      and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You can toggle this on or off as a
      bonus action.</p>
