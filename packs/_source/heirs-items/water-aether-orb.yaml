    value: >-
      <p>This fist-sized sphere contains swirling ocean currents in miniature—blues and greens
      dancing in eternal motion. When held, you can hear distant whale song and feel the pull
      of tides.</p>

      <h3>Properties (while attuned)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can breathe underwater and have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed</li>
        <li>You have resistance to cold damage</li>
        <li>Once per long rest, you can cast <em>Control Water</em> without expending a spell slot</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Orb Resonance</h3>
      <p>You can sense the approximate direction of other Aether Orbs within 1 mile.</p>

      <h3>Dual Orb Effect</h3>
      <p>When carried alongside the Necrotic Aether Orb, the bearer occasionally sees visions of
      death by drowning (necrotic orb) or feels phantom sensations of decay (water orb). These
      are disturbing but not mechanically harmful—yet.</p>
