        <h1>The Sunken Village of Coral Veil</h1>
        <p><em>Adventure for 4 characters of level 6-7, designed for 2-3 sessions</em></p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Beneath the massive watering hole north of the Bottomless Goat lies <strong>Coral Veil</strong>,
        an ancient sea elf settlement that has existed in quiet isolation for centuries. The village was
        founded by sea elves who fled coastal wars of ages past, seeking refuge in this unlikely inland
        location—a vast underwater cavern system fed by deep aquifers connected to distant seas.</p>

        <p>Several weeks ago, a <strong>Water-aspected Aether Orb</strong> drifted into their territory,
        carried by deep currents. The orb's elemental resonance has attracted an Aboleth named
        <strong>Veth'sora</strong>, an ancient creature that has claimed the orb and begun corrupting
        the village's inhabitants through psychic domination.</p>

        <p>The sea hags Mishko encountered previously are not native to Coral Veil—they arrived in
        Veth'sora's wake, drawn by psychic emanations and opportunity.</p>

        <h2>Campaign Connections</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mishko's Earlier Encounter:</strong> Mishko swam into the watering hole previously
          but encountered sharks and sea hags, preventing deeper exploration</li>
          <li><strong>Aether Orb Collection:</strong> This is the second orb the party can acquire
          (Water aspect), following the Necrotic orb from the Bone Mill</li>
          <li><strong>Varrick's Interest:</strong> Varrick will take notice of the party collecting
          multiple orbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Adventure Hook</h1>
        <p>The morning after their victory at the Bone Mill, an unusual visitor appears at the
        Bottomless Goat: a sea elf woman has dragged herself from the watering hole and collapsed
        on the northern edge of the property.</p>

        <div class="dnd5e2 chat-card"><blockquote>
        <p><em>The figure lying in the grass is unlike anyone you've seen in Briar Hollow. Her skin
        carries the blue-green tint of deep water, and delicate fins frame her pointed ears. Gills
        flutter weakly at her throat as she struggles to breathe the open air. Strange, translucent
        burns mark her forearms, weeping a viscous fluid that smells of brine and something fouler
        beneath.</em></p>
        </blockquote></div>

        <h2>Thalindra Wavecrest</h2>
        <p>When revived ([[/check wis 12 format=short]] Medicine or any healing magic), Thalindra
        speaks in halting Common:</p>

        <div class="dnd5e2 chat-card"><blockquote>
        <p><em>"Please... the Coral Veil... my people... something has come. Something old. It speaks
        in our minds, makes us forget ourselves. My grandmother... she resisted long enough to send me.
        The bright stone—it called the horror to us. You must help, or we are lost."</em></p>
        </blockquote></div>

        <h3>Information Thalindra Can Provide:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Coral Veil is a village of ~60 sea elves in underwater caverns beneath the watering hole</li>
          <li>Three weeks ago, a glowing orb drifted in, pulsing with water magic</li>
          <li>Days later, a creature of nightmare arrived—ancient, three-eyed, with tentacles dripping burning slime</li>
          <li>The creature resides in the Pearlheart Chamber, where the orb now rests</li>
          <li>Many villagers are mentally controlled; others hide in outer tunnels</li>
          <li>Sea hags came afterward as opportunistic scavengers</li>
          <li>Her grandmother, Elder Coralline, leads resistance efforts</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Thalindra cannot survive long out of water. The party's
        Decanter of Endless Water can keep her comfortable, or she can wait in the shallows.</p>

        <h1>Part 1: The Descent</h1>

        <h2>Preparing for the Dive</h2>
        <p>The watering hole is approximately 200 feet deep before opening into the cavern system.</p>

        <h3>Underwater Survival Options:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mishko can breathe underwater naturally (Triton) and communicate with sea creatures</li>
          <li>Thalindra provides <strong>4 Pearls of Water Breathing</strong> (8 hours each, held in mouth)</li>
          <li>Creative solutions: Decanter of Endless Water for air bubbles, potions, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="dnd5e2 chat-card"><blockquote>
        <p><em>The watering hole stretches before you, its surface deceptively calm. Sunlight penetrates
        only the first thirty feet before giving way to blue-green twilight. Somewhere far below, in the
        lightless depths, an entire people await rescue—or doom.</em></p>
        </blockquote></div>

        <h2>The Descent (Skill Challenge)</h2>
        <p><strong>Navigation Check:</strong> [[/check wis 13 format=short]] Survival</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Success:</strong> Efficient navigation through current channels</li>
          <li><strong>Failure:</strong> Disoriented, +30 minutes travel time, potentially alerts patrols</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hazard: The Hag's Toll</h2>
        <p>Approximately 80 feet down, the party enters the sea hags' territory.</p>

        <div class="dnd5e2 chat-card"><blockquote>
        <p><em>The water grows murky here, thick with sediment and something else—a greasy, unnatural
        film that clings to your skin. Amid the floating detritus, you spot crude fetishes made of bone
        and kelp, strung between rocky outcroppings like a grotesque curtain. Beyond them, shadows move
        with predatory patience.</em></p>
        </blockquote></div>

        <p><strong>The Three Sea Hags</strong> are opportunists who've been preying on fleeing villagers.</p>

          <li><strong>Scabrine:</strong> Impulsive, violent, easily goaded</li>

        <div class="dnd5e2 chat-card"><blockquote>
        <p><em>The tunnel widens suddenly, and you emerge into a space that steals your breath. A vast
        cavern stretches before you, easily a quarter mile across, its ceiling lost in darkness above.
        Bioluminescent coral in soft blues, greens, and purples clings to every surface, casting the
        space in ethereal twilight.</em></p>
        <p><em>What was once clearly a thriving village now feels like a place holding its breath.
        Elegant structures carved from living coral and mother-of-pearl stand in concentric rings around
        a central chamber that pulses with an unsettling, rhythmic glow. The streets are empty—but you
        sense movement in the shadows, watching.</em></p>

        <h2>The Survivors</h2>
        <p>~20 sea elves remain free, hiding in outer tunnels, led by <strong>Elder Coralline</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Key Information from Coralline:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The aboleth calls itself Veth'sora, claims to be "reclaiming what was always theirs"</li>
          <li>~30 villagers are enthralled, patrolling inner rings</li>
          <li>The creature has psychic reach throughout village—it knows intruders arrived</li>
          <li>Killing the aboleth won't immediately free the enthralled</li>
          <li>The orb is embedded in the central altar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Coralline's Request:</h3>
        <div class="dnd5e2 chat-card"><blockquote>
        <p><em>"I will not ask you to spare all who have fallen. Some... may be beyond saving. But my
        daughter, Thalindra's mother—Pearlescent—she was among the first taken. She serves now as the
        creature's voice. If there is any way to bring her back..."</em></p>

        <div class="dnd5e2 chat-card"><blockquote>
        <p><em>This dome-shaped structure of pale pink coral was once a place of gentle care. Beds of

        <p><em>A sea elf man drifts in the corner, eyes glazed with oily sheen. Mucus drips from his gills,
        movements jerky, unnatural. When he speaks, it is in two voices—his own, frightened and distant,

        <p><em>Small desks of carved stone sit in neat rows, each with slate tablet and chalk stylus. Murals

          <li>There's a "back way" into the Pearlheart Chamber (maintenance tunnel)</li>
          <li>Her father is an enthralled guard; she's been watching him</li>
          <li>The creature "talks in dreams"—even free sea elves have nightmares</li>

        stains on the floor. Weapon racks line the walls, most empty, but some equipment remains.</em></p>
        </blockquote></div>

        <p><strong>Loot:</strong></p>
        <ul>

        <p><em>But the beauty is corrupted. Tendrils of dark mucus web the chamber like a spider's nest. And

        <h1>Victory and Aftermath</h1>

        <div class="dnd5e2 chat-card"><blockquote>
        <p><em>The aboleth's death cry is not a sound but a sensation—a psychic shockwave rippling through
        water, minds, coral. The enthralled collapse, puppet strings cut. Corruption dissipates, and for the
        first time, you see the true beauty of the Pearlheart Chamber—ancient, sacred, finally free.</em></p>
        <p><em>The Water Aether Orb pulses gently on the altar, chaotic swirling calming to gentle, rhythmic
        flow. It feels... waiting.</em></p>
        </blockquote></div>

        <h2>Claiming the Orb</h2>
        <div class="dnd5e2 chat-card"><blockquote>
        <p><em>The orb is cool in your hands—the temperature of a clear mountain stream on a summer day.
        Within it, you see not just water but the essence of water—tides and currents, gentle rain and
        raging tsunamis, the lifeblood of the world. It accepts your touch. It is yours now—another piece
        of a puzzle you are only beginning to understand.</em></p>

        <p>A few days after return, a familiar chill settles over the Bottomless Goat:</p>

        <div class="dnd5e2 chat-card"><blockquote>
        <p><em>A note rests on the bar in elegant script:</em></p>
        <p><em>"Two orbs. Impressive. The water aspect was not my original target, but I find myself...
        intrigued. Our arrangement continues. I will send word when the next piece reveals itself. In the
        meantime, guard what you carry carefully. You are not the only ones hunting."</em></p>
