        <p>Welcome to <strong>Aevir</strong>, a world shaped by ancient magic
        and the echoes of civilizations long past. The lands of Aevir are vast
        and varied, from the frozen peaks of the Northspine Mountains to the
        sun-drenched shores of the Amber Coast.</p>

        <h2>The Age of Legacies</h2>
        <p>The current era, known as the Age of Legacies, follows the collapse
        of the Arcanum Empire three centuries ago. The great magical empire that
        once unified the continent fell to corruption and civil war, leaving behind
        ruins, artifacts, and descendants who still carry echoes of that ancient power.</p>

        <h2>The Heirs</h2>
        <p>Throughout Aevir, certain individuals are born with latent magical
        abilities or mysterious connections to the past. These "Heirs" may carry
        bloodlines touched by ancient pacts, possess fragments of old knowledge,
        or bear marks that identify them as inheritors of forgotten legacies.</p>

        <p>Some embrace their heritage and seek to understand their gifts.
        Others flee from destinies they never asked for. But all Heirs share
        one truth: the past is never truly gone, and their ancestors' choices
        continue to shape the world.</p>
