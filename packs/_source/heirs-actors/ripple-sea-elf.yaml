    biography:
      value: >-
        <p>A young sea elf girl with iridescent blue-green skin and enormous, frightened eyes.
        Her hair is seafoam green, cut short and practical. She clutches a stuffed toy shaped
        like a seahorse.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Approximately 10 years old. Survived by being small, quiet, and clever. Has been
        hiding in the school, watching her enthralled father from afar, hoping he'll "wake up."</p>

          <li>There's a "back way" into the Pearlheart Chamber (maintenance tunnel)</li>
          <li>Her father is one of the enthralled guards</li>
          <li>The creature "talks in dreams"—even free sea elves have nightmares</li>
          <li>Location of air pockets where the aboleth's voice is weaker</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ripple's Secret</h3>
        <p>She found a <strong>Ring of Water Walking</strong> in her grandmother's things.
