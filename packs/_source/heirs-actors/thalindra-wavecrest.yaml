        <p>Thalindra is a young sea elf woman sent by her grandmother, Elder Coralline, to seek
        help from the surface world. Her skin carries the blue-green tint of deep water, and
        delicate fins frame her pointed ears. Gills flutter at her throat.</p>

        <p>She bears translucent burns on her forearms—the telltale sign of aboleth corruption
        from her escape through Veth'sora's territory.</p>
