    biography:
      value: >-
        <p>The aboleth is ancient and horrible—a fish-like body easily twenty feet long, covered
        in mucus that clouds the water around it. Three baleful eyes, each the size of a dinner
        plate, fix upon you with an intelligence that predates civilization. Tentacles thick as
        tree trunks drift lazily in the current.</p>

        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>Ancient, arrogant, and hungry. Claims to be "reclaiming what was always theirs."
        Views surfacers with contempt. Recognizes the necrotic orb's resonance.</p>

        <h3>Voice</h3>
        <p><em>"Ah. The surfacers. I felt you the moment you entered my domain. You carry the
        stink of death-magic—the bone-orb's resonance. Did you think to collect another?
        This one is MINE."</em></p>
