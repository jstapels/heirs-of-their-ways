    biography:
      value: >-
        <p>A sea elf villager now under Veth'sora's psychic control. Their eyes are glazed with
        an oily sheen, and their movements are jerky and puppet-like. When they speak, it is
        in two voices—their own, distant and frightened, and something deeper that resonates
        psychically.</p>

        <h3>Combat Behavior</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fight to incapacitate rather than kill (the aboleth wants new thralls)</li>
          <li>Move with eerie synchronization</li>
          <li>Can be saved if defeated non-lethally</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Aboleth's Thrall</h3>
        <p>The enthralled take 3d6 psychic damage if they are more than 1 mile from Veth'sora
        or if they attempt to resist commands.</p>

        <h3>Breaking Free</h3>
        <p>Enthralled villagers can be cured if kept alive and away from water. They will
        recover over 1d4 days with fractured memories of their time as thralls.</p>
