    biography:
      value: >-
        <p>She might have been beautiful once—her features echo Thalindra's elegance. But her
        eyes are filmed with opalescent mucus, and her movements carry an unsettling fluidity,
        as if something else wears her body like a suit. When she speaks, her voice harmonizes
        with Veth'sora's psychic emanations in a deeply wrong way.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Thalindra's mother, Elder Coralline's daughter. Among the first villagers taken by
        the aboleth. Now serves as its primary lieutenant and "voice," translating psychic
        commands to verbal orders.</p>

        <h3>Combat Modifications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Base: Veteran stat block</li>
          <li>Swimming speed 40 ft.</li>
          <li>Resistance to psychic damage</li>
          <li>Can cast <em>Command</em> at will (DC 13)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>During Combat (Breaking Through)</h3>
        <p>Her true personality occasionally surfaces:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>"Run... please run... I can't stop..."</em></li>
          <li><em>"Tell Thalindra... tell her I tried..."</em></li>
          <li><em>"The dreams... I can't escape the dreams..."</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fate</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Saved (knocked unconscious):</strong> Can be cured, tearful reunion with family</li>
          <li><strong>Killed:</strong> Last moment of clarity thanking killer for ending her suffering</li>
        </ul>
