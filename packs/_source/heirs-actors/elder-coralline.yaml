    biography:
      value: >-
        <p>An elderly sea elf woman with silver-blue skin weathered by centuries. Her hair is
        white as seafoam, worn long and drifting freely in the water. Deep-set eyes the color
        of storm clouds hold both grief and fierce determination. Delicate fins at her temples
        and forearms are tattered with age.</p>

        <p>She wears robes of woven kelp adorned with small shells and pearls, and carries a
        staff of white coral topped with a softly glowing pearl.</p>

        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Speaks slowly and deliberately, weighing each word</li>
          <li>Fiercely protective of her people</li>
          <li>Will not abandon even those who have fallen to the aboleth</li>
          <li>Pragmatic—understands some may need to die</li>
          <li>Deeply spiritual, views the Aether Orb as a "gift gone wrong"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The aboleth calls itself Veth'sora</li>
          <li>~30 villagers are enthralled, ~20 remain free</li>
          <li>Her daughter Pearlescent serves as the aboleth's voice</li>
          <li>Enthralled can be freed if kept alive and away from water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Request</h3>
        <p><em>"I will not ask you to spare all who have fallen. Some... may be beyond saving.
        But my daughter, Thalindra's mother—Pearlescent—she was among the first taken. She
        serves now as the creature's voice. If there is any way to bring her back..."</em></p>
