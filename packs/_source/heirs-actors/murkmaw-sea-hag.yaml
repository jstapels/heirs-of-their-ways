    biography:
      value: >-
        <p>Murkmaw is the calculating leader of a sea hag coven that has established territory
        in the descent shaft to Coral Veil. She speaks in riddles and collects teeth from her
        victims.</p>

        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculating and patient</li>
          <li>Speaks in riddles and double meanings</li>
          <li>Collects teeth from victims</li>
          <li>Always looking for profitable deals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Coven</h3>
        <p>The three hags (Murkmaw, Scabrine, and Weeping Nell) are opportunists who arrived
        after the aboleth. They prey on fleeing sea elves but are not allied with Veth'sora.</p>

        <h3>Negotiation Options</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Magical item, "secrets that cut deep," or future service</li>
          <li><strong>Intimidation (DC 16):</strong> Mention Marrow Titan victory, show necrotic orb</li>
