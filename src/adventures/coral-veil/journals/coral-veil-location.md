# Coral Veil

*Location: Underwater cavern settlement beneath the watering hole north of the Bottomless Goat*

Ancient sea elf sanctuary turned war zone after the arrival of the Water Aether Orb and the aboleth Veth'sora.

## Overview

Coral Veil is a hidden sea elf settlement carved into a quarter-mile underwater cavern fed by deep aquifers. The community survived in isolation for generations until Veth'sora seized the Pearlheart Chamber and began enthralling villagers.

This location is written for a strong level 7 party with Hard-to-Deadly pressure and objective-based alternatives to pure attrition combat.

## Access

### The Watering Hole

- Roughly 200 feet deep before opening into cavern tunnels
- Calm on the surface, dark and high-pressure below
- Sea hags operate in descent territory around 80 feet

### Descent Conditions

- Narrow current channels and low-visibility pockets
- Hag toll zone and patrol interception risk
- Long descents can trigger aboleth-aligned ambushes

## Village Structure

| Ring | Function | Current State |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Outer Ring** | Homes and family alcoves | Damaged, lightly patrolled |
| **Middle Ring** | School, healing house, armory | Contest zone with survivor pockets |
| **Inner Ring** | Leadership chambers and shrine paths | Heavily controlled by thralls |
| **Pearlheart Chamber** | Sacred orb sanctuary | Veth'sora's lair |

## Alert Clock (Escalation)

Track village response as the party acts.

- **Alert 1:** Sparse patrols; survivors can move safely
- **Alert 2:** Patrol groups gain 2 additional thralls
- **Alert 3:** Psychic surges in the inner ring ([[/save WIS 14]] or [[/damage 1d6 psychic]])
- **Alert 4:** Veth'sora begins the boss fight pre-buffed and calls faster reinforcements

## Key Mission Objectives

Complete at least 2 objectives to improve final outcomes.

1. **Stabilize Healing House**
- Secure supplies, confront Healer Orin, and establish triage
- Benefit: one 10-minute rally to spend hit dice before boss fight

2. **Rescue School Survivors**
- Protect Ripple and hidden children, avoid patrol interception
- Benefit: unlock safer maintenance tunnel route

3. **Rearm Resistance**
- Retake armory under pressure
- Benefit: resistance removes 2 enthralled guards from final chamber defense

## Factions and Threats

### Resistance Cell

Led by Elder Coralline Wavecrest, operating from outer tunnels.

### Enthralled Villagers

Former residents under aboleth domination. Non-lethal resolution is possible if they are subdued and treated after Veth'sora's hold is broken.

### Hag Coven

Murkmaw, Scabrine, and Weeping Nell control the descent shaft and trade in leverage, debts, and desperation.

### Veth'sora

Aboleth tyrant anchored to the Water Orb in the Pearlheart Chamber. Uses psychic control, minion screens, and battlefield control to prevent orb removal.

## Rich Location Beats

### Healing House

> *Cracked ceramic vials drift in milky clouds while a healer's prayer wheel turns slowly on its own in the current.*

### School

> *Half-finished murals show a peaceful history interrupted by a dark three-eyed shape painted in quick, frightened strokes.*

### Armory

> *Racks of coral-forged weapons stand mostly empty, with blood-dark stains in the seams where defenders made their last stand.*

### Pearlheart Chamber

> *A cathedral dome of living coral pulses with sick rhythm as dark mucus webs cling to altar stone around the Water Orb.*

## Rewards and Strategic Value

- Recovery of the **Water Aether Orb**
- Coral Veil sanctuary access for future arcs
- Underwater intelligence routes and deep-aquifer passage leads
- Mid-tier treasure and selected magic rewards from Veth'sora's hoard

## Aftermath Possibilities

- **High rescue outcome:** strong alliance and recurring aid
- **Mixed outcome:** political fractures and trauma-focused side quests
- **Heavy losses:** alliance still possible, but under grief and mistrust
