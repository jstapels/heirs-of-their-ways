# The Sunken Village of Coral Veil

*Adventure for 4 strong characters of level 7, designed for 4 sessions (expandable to 5)*

## Overview

Beneath the massive watering hole north of the Bottomless Goat lies Coral Veil, an ancient sea elf settlement that has existed in quiet isolation for centuries. The village was founded by sea elves who fled coastal wars of ages past, seeking refuge in this unlikely inland location: a vast underwater cavern system fed by deep aquifers connected to distant seas.

Several weeks ago, a Water-aspected Aether Orb drifted into their territory, carried by deep currents. Its elemental resonance attracted an aboleth named **Veth'sora**, an ancient tyrant that has claimed the orb and begun corrupting the village through psychic domination.

This version of the adventure assumes a strong level 7 party and runs combat slightly above normal baseline. Most fights are Hard to Deadly by default, but every major conflict includes a non-lethal or objective-focused path.

## Connection to Campaign

- **Mishko's Earlier Encounter:** Mishko swam into the watering hole previously but encountered sharks and sea hags, preventing deeper exploration.
- **Aether Orb Collection:** This is the second orb the party can acquire (Water aspect), following the Necrotic orb from the Bone Mill.
- **Varrick's Interest:** Varrick will take notice of the party collecting multiple orbs.

## Adventure Hook

The morning after victory at the Bone Mill, an unusual visitor appears at the Bottomless Goat: a sea elf woman has dragged herself from the watering hole and collapsed on the northern edge of the property.

> *The figure lying in the grass is unlike anyone you've seen in Briar Hollow. Her skin carries the blue-green tint of deep water, and delicate fins frame her pointed ears. Gills flutter weakly at her throat as she struggles to breathe open air. Strange, translucent burns mark her forearms, weeping viscous fluid that smells of brine and old rot.*

### Thalindra Wavecrest

When revived ([[/check Medicine 12]] or any healing magic), Thalindra speaks in halting Common:

> *"Please... Coral Veil... my people... something old is in our minds. It wears my mother's voice."*

**Information Thalindra Can Provide:**
- Coral Veil houses roughly 60 sea elves in caverns beneath the watering hole.
- The glowing water orb arrived about three weeks ago.
- Veth'sora now occupies the Pearlheart Chamber.
- Roughly half the village is enthralled.
- Sea hags in the descent shaft are opportunists, not loyal servants.

**Important:** Thalindra cannot remain long out of water without support.

## NPC Spotlight Kit

Use these when introducing key NPCs.

### Elder Coralline Wavecrest (Resistance Leader)

> *An elderly sea elf with silver-blue skin and storm-gray eyes, wrapped in kelp-woven robes and holding a white coral staff capped with a dim pearl.*

- **Roleplay Hook:** Speaks slowly, weighs every loss, refuses to abandon her people.
- **Conflict Lever:** She will authorize dangerous distraction tactics if civilians can be saved.
- **Portrait Prompt:** "elder sea elf druid matriarch, silver-blue skin, white hair drifting in water, coral staff with glowing pearl, sorrowful but resolute expression, bioluminescent cavern background"

### Pearlescent Wavecrest (Enthralled Lieutenant)

> *A once-proud sea elf warrior gliding in perfect stillness, her opalescent eyes filmed with mucus while another voice rides beneath her own.*

- **Roleplay Hook:** Brief flashes of self break through during high emotional beats.
- **Conflict Lever:** Non-lethal subdual can save her.
- **Portrait Prompt:** "sea elf veteran corrupted by aboleth influence, opalescent mucus over eyes, elegant armor, tragic expression, underwater psychic glow"

### Veth'sora (Aboleth Tyrant)

> *A colossal aberration coiled around the altar like a monarch on a throne, three eyes fixed on you with ancient contempt.*

- **Roleplay Hook:** Speaks as if history itself belongs to it.
- **Conflict Lever:** It values dominance and leverage more than death; it can be forced into retreat.
- **Portrait Prompt:** "ancient aboleth in luminous coral dome, dark mucus tendrils, three baleful eyes, regal predatory posture, eerie underwater light"

### Murkmaw (Hag Broker)

> *A sea hag draped in kelp and fishbone charms, grinning through black gums while strings of teeth clack at her belt.*

- **Roleplay Hook:** Prefers debts and secrets over clean violence.
- **Conflict Lever:** Offer leverage, not mercy.
- **Portrait Prompt:** "sea hag queen in murky water, kelp mantle, bone fetishes, predatory grin, ritual totems hanging in dark current"

## Part 1: The Descent

### Dive Preparation

The watering hole is approximately 200 feet deep before opening into the cavern system.

**Underwater Survival Options:**
- Mishko breathes underwater naturally.
- Thalindra provides 4 Pearls of Water Breathing (8 hours each).
- Creative solutions are valid (potions, spells, gear, Decanter tricks).

### Descent Skill Challenge (3 Successes Before 2 Failures)

- [[/check Survival 14]] to read current channels.
- [[/check Athletics 14]] to navigate pressure shifts and undertows.
- [[/check Perception 15]] to identify safe descent lanes.

**Success:** Reach Coral Veil undetected.
**Failure:** Patrols are alerted and the first village encounter starts at high alert.

### Encounter: The Hag's Toll (Hard)

At 80 feet down, the party enters hag territory.

**Baseline for Strong Party:**
- 3 Sea Hags (standard)
- 2 Reef Sharks circling the negotiation zone

**Resolution Paths:**
- **Combat:** Hags fight aggressively, then attempt escape at half strength.
- **Debt Bargain:** Hags allow passage in exchange for a future service.
- **Intimidation:** [[/check Intimidation 17]] with real leverage (Marrow Titan, orb power, displays of force).
- **Deception:** [[/check Deception 16]] by claiming authority from a greater abyssal patron.

**Non-combat win benefit:** If the party makes a deal, one hag secretly gives a warning about Veth'sora's fear of losing the orb anchor.

### Encounter: Currentbreaker Ambush (Hard)

If the party spends too long or fails descent checks:
- 2 Hunter Sharks
- 4 enthralled sea elf scouts (use Scout statistics with swim 40 ft.)

Goal is to pressure resources before village entry without overshadowing the main arc.

## Part 2: Coral Veil Under Siege

### Entering the Village

> *The tunnel widens into a cavern so vast its ceiling disappears into darkness. Living coral in blues and sea-greens paints the settlement in soft, ghostly light. Streets of mother-of-pearl stand silent, but silence here feels watched.*

### Alert Clock (Escalation System)

Start at **Alert 1**. Increase by 1 for loud fights, failed stealth, or long rests in hostile zones.

- **Alert 1:** Sparse patrols, survivors can move.
- **Alert 2:** Patrol size increases by 2 thralls.
- **Alert 3:** Psychic surges impose [[/save WIS 14]] or [[/damage 1d6 psychic]] when entering inner ring.
- **Alert 4:** Veth'sora pre-buffs with mirror images and sends reinforcements during boss phase 1.

### Village Objectives (Complete 2 of 3)

Each completed objective weakens the final encounter or improves survivor outcomes.

1. **Stabilize the Healing House**
- Defeat or calm Healer Orin.
- Secure potions and anti-psychic supplies.
- Benefit: party gains 1 additional short-rest-equivalent rally before boss fight (10 minutes, spend hit dice).

2. **Rescue the School Survivors**
- Protect Ripple and 2 hidden children while avoiding patrol interception.
- Benefit: reveals maintenance tunnel plus a safer retreat route.

3. **Rearm the Resistance**
- Recover armory weapons while fending off a tactical patrol.
- Benefit: Coralline's resistance removes 2 enthralled guards from the boss setup.

### Recommended Village Encounters (Strong Party)

- **Patrol Alpha (Medium-Hard):** 6 enthralled guards + Sergeant Kelvar.
- **Patrol Beta (Hard):** 4 enthralled guards + 1 enthralled veteran + giant octopus.
- **Psychic Pulse Event (Setpiece):** At Alert 3+, all creatures in middle ring make [[/save INT 14]] or lose reactions for 1 round.

## Part 3: The Pearlheart Chamber Assault

### Approaches

| Option | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **A: Front Breach** | High-combat route; immediate clash with chamber guards. |
| **B: Ripple's Tunnel** | [[/check Stealth 15]] group check; advantage on initiative if successful. |
| **C: Coralline's Feint** | Removes half outer guards but risks survivor casualties if prolonged. |

### Chamber Description

> *A dome of living coral rises overhead, every surface pulsing in slow rhythm. At the center, a mother-of-pearl altar cradles the Water Orb, its beauty drowned beneath dark mucus strands like a spider's web in the sea. Coiled around it, Veth'sora watches with the patience of something that remembers empires before maps.*

### Boss Structure (Tough Baseline)

#### Phase 1: Orb Defenders

- Pearlescent Wavecrest (enhanced veteran)
- 2 Hunter Sharks
- 6 enthralled sea elf guards (minus any removed by objective success)

Trigger to Phase 2:
- After 2 rounds, or immediately if the orb is disturbed.

#### Phase 2: Veth'sora Unleashed

**Veth'sora, Strong-Party Baseline:**
- HP 210
- Legendary Actions: 3/round
- Orb Aura: Regain 15 HP at start of turn within 30 ft. of orb
- Psychic Lash DC 15, [[/damage 3d8 psychic]], stunned until end of next turn on fail
- Lair Action DC 15 each round (cold surge, charm wave, mucus restraint zones)

**Tactical Notes:**
- Prioritizes control on fragile damage dealers, then isolates frontliners.
- Uses thralls to block orb access and force action-economy strain.
- Attempts retreat at 40 HP if the orb is removed.

#### Phase 3: Endgame Choice

At low HP, give three valid resolutions:
- **Kill:** Slay Veth'sora; full liberation route.
- **Rout:** Force it to flee; recurring villain route.
- **Severance Ritual:** Use a 3-success skill challenge while holding the orb.

### Severance Ritual (Alternative Conflict End)

3 successes before 2 failures using:
- [[/check Arcana 16]] to disrupt the psychic link
- [[/check Religion 15]] to sanctify the altar
- [[/check Athletics 15]] to hold orb in place against current shear
- [[/check Persuasion 15]] to call Pearlescent back to herself

On success:
- Veth'sora loses orb regeneration and must retreat or die within 2 rounds.
- Pearlescent gains immediate save to break domination.

On failure:
- Orb surges, all creatures within 20 ft. take [[/damage 3d6 cold]].
