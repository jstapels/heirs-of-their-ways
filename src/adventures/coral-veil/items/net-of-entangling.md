# Net of Entangling
*Adventuring gear (net), uncommon*

A net woven from enchanted kelp fibers that constrict when they sense struggling.

**Properties:** Functions as a net, but the target must succeed on a [[/save STR 13]] saving throw to break free rather than simply cutting it. The net has AC 12 and 10 HP.

**Source:** Coral Veil armory.
