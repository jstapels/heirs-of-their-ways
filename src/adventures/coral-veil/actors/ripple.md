# Ripple
*Young sea elf survivor*

A ten-year-old sea elf girl with iridescent blue-green skin and wide, frightened eyes. Her seafoam-green hair is cropped short, and she clutches a stuffed seahorse toy for comfort.

## Biography {.system.details.biography.value}
- Survived by hiding in the school and avoiding enthralled patrols.
- Knows a maintenance tunnel that leads into the Pearlheart Chamber and where air pockets weaken Veth'sora's psychic voice.
- Her father is among the enthralled guards; she desperately wants him saved.
- Secretly carries a **Ring of Water Walking** found among her grandmother's belongings and will trade it for her father's rescue.

## Roleplaying Notes
