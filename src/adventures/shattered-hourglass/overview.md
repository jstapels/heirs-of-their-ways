# The Shattered Hourglass

*Adventure for 4 strong characters of level 7, designed for 4 sessions (expandable to 5)*

## Overview

The party enters a damaged chronomantic temple where their ancestors once fought to bind the Serpent of Moments. Time has frayed in the halls: old wards now misfire, scavengers feed on leaked temporal energy, and fragments of memory walk as if alive.

This adventure is combat-forward for a strong level 7 group, with Hard-to-Deadly encounters as the default pace. Each major conflict still supports alternative endings through negotiation, containment rituals, or objective-based victory.

## Connection to Campaign

- **Ancestral Echoes:** The party retraces Torvath, Vaelith, Quickpaw, and Aldric's final march.
- **Loamvale Arc:** The lower temple houses the Chrono-Hydra and one more Aether-Orb clue.
- **Orb War:** Signals that Varrick and Lucien's networks are now tracking temporal anomalies.

---

## Session Framework (4 Sessions)

1. **Session 1: Approach to the Broken Temple**
Travel hazard, rival scouts, and entry into warped ruins.
2. **Session 2: Hall of Echoing Moments**
Full tactical encounter in the hourglass hall plus truth-door roleplay.
3. **Session 3: Lower Temple Trials**
Three chamber gauntlet with elite enemies and a social/risk negotiation node.
4. **Session 4: Serpent of Moments Finale**
Chrono-Hydra confrontation with slay, reseal, or bargain-with-cost endings.

Optional Session 5:
- Time-ripple fallout in Loamvale, rival retaliation, and ancestor epilogue scenes.

## Core Tone and Play Pattern

- Combat is dangerous and positional.
- Terrain matters in every major fight.
- Roleplay scenes unlock tactical advantages, not just lore.
- Player choices affect the final boss state and rescue outcomes.

---

## Major Areas

### 1) The Fractured Causeway (Session 1)

> *A stone bridge hangs over a canyon where broken clocks and rusted chains sway with no wind. Every footstep sounds half a second late, as if the world is listening before it answers.*

**Encounter Options (Pick One):**
- **Temporal Raiders (Hard):** 1 veteran captain, 4 scouts, 1 chrono-mage adept.
- **Shatterquake Swarm (Hard):** environmental collapse plus 3 temporal predators.

**Alternative Path:**
- Outmaneuver raiders with [[/check Deception 16]] or [[/check Survival 15]] and avoid full attrition before Session 2.

### 2) Hall of Echoing Moments (Session 2)

Use the existing hall journal and DM notes as the core setpiece.

**Strong-party baseline update:**
- Add one extra Flickerswarm.
- Trigger one additional tile surge at initiative count 10 in rounds 2 and 4.
- Keep truth-door scene as emotional anchor after the combat spike.

### 3) The Lower Temple (Session 3)

Three connected chambers, each with combat and non-combat resolution routes:

#### The Chamber of Borrowed Years

> *Statues of children and elders share the same face at different ages, all turned toward a dry fountain where amber water hovers in midair, refusing to fall.*

- **Combat:** 2 temporal sentinels + 1 chronal ooze (Hard).
- **Alternative:** Offer memory fragments (roleplay confessions) to deactivate sentinels.

#### The Archive of Unfinished Futures

> *Shelves of stone tablets shift on their own, swapping places as whispers recite events that have not happened yet.*

- **Combat:** time-warped scribes and echo blades (Hard).
- **Alternative:** [[/check Arcana 16]] + [[/check Investigation 15]] to route around guardians.

#### The Anchor Vault

> *A circular room of chained hourglasses suspended over black water. One chain is freshly broken.*

- **Combat:** elite rival strike team arrives mid-scene.
- **Alternative:** bargain with rival leader for temporary truce against the hydra.

### 4) Serpent of Moments Lair (Session 4)

> *The final chamber is a sunken amphitheater of broken dials and flooded stone terraces. In the center, a hydra coils around a cracked hourglass monolith, each head watching a different second of your life.*

**Chrono-Hydra Structure:**
- Multi-phase boss with lair actions tied to time distortion.
- Starts with 5 heads and gains tactical reactions when heads are severed.
- Uses forced movement, delayed-damage effects, and initiative disruption.

**End States:**
- **Slay:** destroy the hydra and collapse the temporal nest.
- **Reseal:** complete a ritual under pressure (skill challenge during combat).
- **Bargain-with-Cost:** bind hydra to a pact that demands recurring sacrifice or oversight.

## Key NPCs and Rich Introduction Beats

### Warden Ilyra (Echo Custodian)

> *A translucent armored figure whose face flickers between four different eras, speaking in a voice layered like a chorus.*

- **Use:** gatekeeper for lower temple access; can become ally or miniboss.
- **Hook:** respects honesty and legacy, distrusts opportunists.
- **Portrait Prompt:** "ghostly armored warden with multiple age-shifted faces, amber temporal glow, ancient temple background"

### Kestrel Vane (Rival Recovery Captain)

> *A scarred treasure-hunter in lacquered scale armor, calm even while blades are drawn, always calculating the profitable future.*

- **Use:** rival faction leader in Session 3.
- **Hook:** prefers negotiated leverage over mutual destruction.
- **Portrait Prompt:** "human mercenary captain with scars, practical ornate armor, time-ruin artifacts, confident tactical expression"

### The Serpent of Moments (Chrono-Hydra)

> *Each head moves with a different rhythm: one jerks ahead in sudden bursts, one lags like a delayed echo, one tracks you before you move.*

- **Use:** final antagonist and central moral pressure point.
- **Hook:** not merely hungry; it is a living failure state of a broken ritual.
- **Portrait Prompt:** "mythic hydra infused with temporal magic, multiple heads with different motion blur, flooded ancient clockwork arena"

## Combat Tuning for Strong Level 7 Party

Use this baseline unless the party is depleted.

- Most fights should include one control enemy plus one brute.
- Boss-adjacent fights should have reinforcements or timed objectives.
- Reserve at least one hard crowd-control effect per major battle.
- Reward smart positioning and target priority more than raw DPR races.

### Difficulty Ladder

| Scene | Target Difficulty |
|------|-------------------|
| Session 1 opener | Medium-Hard |
| Hall of Echoing Moments | Hard-Deadly |
| Lower Temple Chamber 1 | Hard |
| Lower Temple Chamber 2 | Hard |
| Lower Temple Chamber 3 | Hard-Deadly |
| Chrono-Hydra Finale | Deadly |

## Alternate Conflict Endings

To keep combat-forward play while preserving agency:

- Every major chapter has at least one non-lethal or objective resolution.
- Non-combat wins should save resources, reduce casualties, or improve finale conditions.
- Diplomacy is never a free skip; it should carry risk, obligations, or future complications.
