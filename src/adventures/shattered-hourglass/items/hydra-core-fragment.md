# Hydra Core Fragment
*Wondrous item, rare (crafting catalyst)*

A dense crystal shard recovered from the Serpent of Moments, humming with contained temporal pressure.

**Use:** Counts as a rare crafting catalyst for time-, force-, or divination-themed magic items.

**Field Use (1/day):** As a bonus action, gain +10 feet movement until end of turn and advantage on one Dexterity saving throw made this turn.
