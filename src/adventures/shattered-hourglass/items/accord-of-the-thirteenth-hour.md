# Accord of the Thirteenth Hour
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

A black-silver medallion cut from impossible clockwork, warm to the touch whenever a bargain is about to break.

**Properties:**
- You gain proficiency in Insight (or expertise if already proficient).
- You can cast *Suggestion* once per long rest (save DC 15).
- Once per long rest, when a creature you can see within 30 feet misses you with an attack, you can force it to make a [[/save WIS 15]]{DC 15 Wisdom save}; on a failure, it can't target you until the end of its next turn.

**Ending Link:** Recommended reward for the **Bargain-With-Cost** ending.
