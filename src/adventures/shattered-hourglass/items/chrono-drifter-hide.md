# Chrono-Drifter Hide
*Armor (leather), uncommon (requires attunement)*

Tough leather stitched from the Chrono-Drifter's hide, faintly warm to the touch and heavy with lingering temporal residue.

**Properties:**
- You have resistance to necrotic damage.
- Once per long rest, when you take damage, you can use your reaction to heal for half the damage taken (rounded down), borrowing vitality from a past moment.
