# Temporal Seal Sigil
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

A bronze-and-amber signet etched with nested hourglass runes. It resonates near unstable magic.

**Properties:**
- You gain advantage on checks made to identify magical traps, wards, or magical time distortions.
- You can cast *Dispel Magic* once per long rest.
- When you fail a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you can reroll it once per long rest.
