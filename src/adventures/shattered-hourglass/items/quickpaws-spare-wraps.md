# Quickpaw's Spare Wraps
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a monk)*

Soft cloth hand wraps left behind by Quickpaw before the final battle. They hum faintly with readiness.

**Properties:**
- You gain a +1 bonus to unarmed strike attack and damage rolls.
- When you roll initiative, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
