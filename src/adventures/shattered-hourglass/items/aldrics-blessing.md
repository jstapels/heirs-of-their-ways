# Aldric's Blessing
*Wondrous item, uncommon (one-time use)*

A cool spark of Aldric's foresight, waiting for the perfect moment.

**Blessing:** Once before your next long rest, when you fail an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. You must declare this after seeing the result but before the DM declares success or failure.
