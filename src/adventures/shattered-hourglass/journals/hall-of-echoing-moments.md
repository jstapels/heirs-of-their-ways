# Hall of Echoing Moments

*Location: Ancient chamber of hourglass pillars and unstable temporal tiles*

## Entering the Hall

> *The passage opens into a vast rectangular hall, and your breath catches. This place is ancient, far older than the cave entrance suggested. Rows of pillars carved like hourglasses line the space, though several have toppled or cracked. Bronze sconces still cling to the walls, long empty of flame, yet a soft amber luminescence permeates everything, sourceless and strange.*
>
> *The floor tells a story of violence. Scattered armor fragments, pitted and corroded by centuries. A massive pillar lies fallen, creating a stone bridge across a grid of floor tiles that pulse with faint, sickly light, dimmer than they once were. Blade gouges and scorch marks speak of desperate combat.*
>
> *At the base of one standing pillar, you notice old, preserved words, as if time chose to remember them:*
>
> *"To our children's children: We walked this path so you might walk it safer. Remember us."*
>
> *Below the words: four symbols etched with care. A bee. A wave. A rabbit's foot. An apple.*
>
> *Threk, you feel a strange warmth in your chest. Mishko, the wave seems to ripple as you look at it. Mats, your feet itch to move. Ilizar, the apple looks freshly carved, though it clearly isn't.*
>
> *At the far end of the hall, a great door stands closed, an hourglass carved into its center, half-filled with golden sand that moves slowly, grain by grain, upward.*

## The Changed Chamber

### What Remains

- The grid of temporal tiles still exists, though weakened
- The fallen pillar still provides a partial bridge
- The far door still requires a "sacrifice" to open, though it has changed
- Echoes of the ancestral battle flicker into visibility

### What Has Changed

- The Temporal Wardens are gone, their cores long harvested or crumbled
- Trap tiles are unstable, their effects now unpredictable
- Something new has moved in, drawn by leaking temporal energy
- The puzzle has been corrupted, requiring a different solution

## Temporal Echoes

> *Movement catches your eye, translucent figures fighting across the hall. A massive Loxodon in emerald armor, shield raised against three armored constructs. A Triton woman singing, her voice causing reality to ripple. A Harengon moving faster than sight, striking and retreating. A human man appearing from shadows to drive a blade into a construct's back.*
>
> *The images flicker, repeat, fade. You see the same six seconds of combat play out again and again, like a memory the hall cannot release.*
>
> *Then new figures appear, these ones solid, present, watching you with hungry intent.*

## The Inhabitants: Temporal Scavengers

Creatures once mundane have been warped into temporal predators: **Flickerswarms**, a **Sporeling Colony**, and the alpha **Chrono-Drifter**.

> *They emerge from cracks in the walls, from shadows between pillars, from the very air itself. Rats with too many legs, their movements stuttering forward and backward. Moths with wings that beat at different speeds, leaving trails of amber dust. A fungal mass that grows and shrinks and grows again with each pulse of temporal light.*
>
> *Then something larger pulls itself from behind a fallen pillar, a creature that might have once been a wolf. Its front half is skeletal and ancient; its hindquarters are muscled and vital; its head exists in a blur between puppy and elder. When it opens its mouth, you hear it bark, howl, and whimper all at once.*

## Combat Encounter: The Scavenger Pack

**Enemies (Strong Party Baseline):**
- **Chrono-Drifter** (1) - alpha predator
- **Flickerswarm** (3) - temporally warped vermin
- **Sporeling Colony** (1) - fungal mass feeding on temporal residue

### Tactics

**Chrono-Drifter**
- Waits for a Flickerswarm to mark a target with amber light before striking
- Uses its howl when multiple party members cluster together
- Focuses on the heaviest damage dealer
- Retreats behind the Sporeling Colony if badly wounded

**Flickerswarms**
- One pressures the backline (Mishko) to outline a target
- One supports the Chrono-Drifter by marking its prey
- Use Temporal Scatter to reposition after area damage

**Sporeling Colony**
- Anchors the center, covering the battlefield with its spore aura
- Slams anyone who closes
- Uses Spore Burst when multiple enemies are in range

## Terrain Features

### The Fallen Pillar Bridge

The collapsed pillar creates a safe path across part of the grid, but it is unstable.

- Creatures can walk along the pillar safely
- If more than 500 pounds of weight is on any 10-foot section, that section crumbles ([[/save dex dc 13]]{DC 13 Dexterity save} or fall 5 feet onto a random tile below)
- The Chrono-Drifter knows this and may lure heavy characters onto weak sections

### The Weakened Grid

The floor tiles still pulse with temporal energy, but they are unstable. Triggering a trap tile now has different effects than before.

**[[/save wis dc 13]]{Wisdom Save DC 13}** when stepping on a trap tile. On failure, roll 1d6:

| Roll | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Temporal Echo:** A ghostly copy of you from 6 seconds ago appears and takes the same action you just took. If that was an attack, it attacks the same target (using your stats). The echo then vanishes. |
| 2 | **Future Glimpse:** You see what you're about to do and can adjust. Gain advantage on your next attack roll or ability check within 1 minute. |
| 3 | **Past Pain:** You experience a wound from your past. Take 2d6 psychic damage as an old injury flares. |
| 4 | **Borrowed Time:** Your speed doubles until the end of your next turn, but you cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn. |
| 5 | **Moment Frozen:** You are restrained until the end of your next turn, caught in a frozen moment. |
| 6 | **Wild Surge:** Raw temporal energy discharges. All creatures within 10 feet (including you) must make a [[/save con dc 14]]{DC 14 Constitution save} or take 3d6 force damage (half on success). |

**Strong Party Pressure Pulse:**
- At initiative count 10 in rounds 2 and 4, one unstable tile cluster surges.
- Creatures standing on affected tiles make a [[/save dex dc 14]]{DC 14 Dexterity save} or take [[/damage 2d6 force]] and are pushed 5 feet.

**Identifying Safe Tiles:**
- [[/check arcana dc 14]]{Arcana (DC 14)}: Identify safe tiles in a 15-foot radius
- [[/check perception dc 15]]{Perception (DC 15)}: Notice which tiles the scavengers avoid
- [[/check investigation dc 13]]{Investigation (DC 13)}: Follow ancestor footprints still visible in the dust
- [[/check insight dc 12]]{Insight (DC 12)}: The ancestral symbols glow faintly when pointing toward safe tiles

### The Ancestral Carvings

As a bonus action, a character with a bloodline connection can touch their family's symbol and make a [[/check religion dc 12]]{DC 12 Religion check} or [[/check arcana dc 12]]{Arcana check}.

- **Bee (Threk):** Threk and allies within 10 feet gain temp HP equal to his proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier (5 temp HP)
- **Wave (Mishko):** Mishko can immediately use Bardic Inspiration on an ally as a free action
- **Rabbit's Foot (Mats):** Mats can take the Disengage action as a free action, and his movement does not provoke opportunity attacks until the end of his turn
- **Apple (Ilizar):** Ilizar becomes invisible until the end of his next turn or until he attacks or casts a spell

Each symbol can be activated once per short rest.

### The Standing Pillars

The remaining intact pillars provide three-quarters cover and tactical leverage.

- A character can use an action to study the pillar carvings and make a [[/check history dc 14]]{DC 14 History check}. On success, they understand the original pattern of safe tiles and can guide allies (allies gain advantage on saves against trap tile effects for 1 minute).
- A pillar can be toppled with a [[/check athletics dc 18]]{DC 18 Athletics check}, dealing 4d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures in a 15-foot line ([[/save dex dc 15]]{DC 15 Dexterity save} for half).

## The Puzzle: Opening the Door

> *The great door remains impassive, the hourglass carved into its surface still half-filled with slowly rising sand. Unlike the chaos of battle behind you, this feels patient, waiting.*
>
> *As you approach, you notice something your ancestors couldn't have seen. The hourglass carving has changed. Where once it was empty and then half-filled by sacrifice, it now shows sand flowing in both directions simultaneously, up and down, past and future at once.*
>
> *Around the hourglass, four recesses appear, each shaped like one of the ancestral symbols: a bee, a wave, a rabbit's foot, an apple.*
>
> *The door speaks, not in words but in understanding that blooms in your mind:*
>
> *"The ancestors gave of themselves. The descendants must give differently. Not time, but truth. Not sacrifice, but acknowledgment. Tell me what you carry, and I will open."*

### The Four Truths

Each character must stand before their family's symbol and speak a genuine truth about themselves, a burden, fear, hope, or secret. This is a roleplaying moment, not a mechanical one.

**Guidance for Players:**

The door does not judge the content, only the honesty. Examples:
- A fear: "I am afraid that I will never be good enough for my family."
- A burden: "I carry guilt for those I couldn't save."
- A hope: "I hope one day I will find where I belong."
- A secret: "I have never told anyone that..."
- A truth about the ancestor: "I carry the weight of what you sacrificed."

**Prompts for Each Character:**

- **Threk (Bee):** Torvath bound himself to this place. What truth do you carry as his descendant?
- **Mishko (Wave):** Vaelith's song still echoes. What truth flows through you?
- **Mats (Rabbit's Foot):** Quickpaw's essence waits. What truth propels you forward?
- **Ilizar (Apple):** Aldric's plans kept secrets. What truth do you keep in shadow?

### Mechanical Support (If Needed)

If players struggle, offer one of the following:

- [[/check insight dc 12]]{Insight DC 12} to feel what kind of truth the door seeks
- [[/check performance dc 14]]{Performance DC 14} or [[/check persuasion dc 14]]{Persuasion DC 14} to speak a truth that resonates
- [[/check religion dc 13]]{Religion DC 13} to feel an ancestor's presence guide the words

**Failure:** If a character lies or refuses, their symbol glows red and they take 2d6 psychic damage. They can try again.

### The Door Opens

> *As the fourth truth is spoken, the symbols glow with warm amber light. The sand in the hourglass pauses, hangs suspended, then begins to flow in a single direction, upward toward the future.*
>
> *The door swings open silently, revealing steps that descend into deeper darkness. But the darkness is not absolute. Somewhere below, amber light pulses like a heartbeat.*
>
> *And as you pass through the doorway, you hear four voices speaking in unison:*
>
> *"Well done, children. Now finish what we started. Free what we bound. End what we could only contain."*

## Treasure and Rewards

### From the Scavengers

- **Chrono-Drifter Hide:** Craftable into leather armor (requires attunement). Grants resistance to necrotic damage and, once per long rest, when you take damage you can use your reaction to heal for half the damage taken.
- **Temporal Dust (3 vials):** Material component for Divination spells (negates components worth 100 gp or less). Alternatively, throwing a vial creates a 10-foot radius cloud for 1 round; creatures in the cloud must succeed on a [[/save con dc 12]]{DC 12 Constitution save} or be outlined in amber light (as *Faerie Fire*) for 1 minute.
- **Sporeling Heartstone:** Dense fungal node worth 200 gp; used to brew a *Potion of Longevity* (reverses aging by 1d6+6 years, no negative side effect when brewed this way).

### Hidden in the Hall

**[[/check investigation dc 16]]{Investigation (DC 16)}** finds a weathered journal in a cracked pillar with partial entries:

> *"...the serpent guards the orb, but it is not the true danger. The thing within the orb, the thing it contains, that is what we must bind. If it ever escapes..."*
>
> *"...Aldric has a plan, as always. He won't tell us the details, only that 'the door will remember.' I trust him, though I know I shouldn't. We all do. That's his gift and his curse..."*
>
> *"...Tomorrow we face what waits below. If anyone reads this, know that we did not go unwilling. We chose this. For family. For the future. For the children we will never meet but hope will live free of this shadow..."*
>
> *"...Remember us."*

The journal includes a partial sketch of the lower temple chamber, the Chrono-Hydra ("Serpent of Moments"), and notes about its temporal heads.

**Beneath the fallen pillar** ([[/check perception dc 17]]{Perception DC 17} or [[/check investigation dc 15]]{Investigation DC 15}) lies an ancient weapon rack. One item survived:

- **Quickpaw's Spare Wraps** (*Wraps of Readiness*, uncommon, requires attunement by a monk). Grants +1 to unarmed strike attack and damage rolls. When you roll initiative, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### From Speaking Truth

Each character who speaks a genuine truth gains a one-time blessing from their ancestor:

- **Torvath's Blessing (Threk):** Once before your next long rest, when an ally within 30 feet would be reduced to 0 hit points, use your reaction to reduce them to 1 hit point instead.
- **Vaelith's Blessing (Mishko):** Once before your next long rest, when you cast a spell that requires a saving throw, you can force one target to make that save with disadvantage.
- **Quickpaw's Blessing (Mats):** Once before your next long rest, when you hit with an unarmed strike, maximize the damage instead of rolling.
- **Aldric's Blessing (Ilizar):** Once before your next long rest, when you fail an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Declare this after seeing the result but before the DM declares success or failure.
