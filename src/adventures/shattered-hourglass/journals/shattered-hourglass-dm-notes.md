# Shattered Hourglass - DM Notes

## Adventure Length

- Target: 4 sessions (expandable to 5)
- Party baseline: strong level 7

## Session Pacing

1. Session 1: Fractured Causeway approach and opening conflict
2. Session 2: Hall of Echoing Moments setpiece and truth door
3. Session 3: Lower temple trial gauntlet
4. Session 4: Chrono-Hydra finale and resolution

## Difficulty Guidance

- Default combats should sit at Hard or higher.
- Use environmental pressure in at least one fight per session.
- Keep one non-lethal/objective path per major scene.

## Fallback Tuning

### If party is overperforming
- Add one elite bodyguard to chamber encounters.
- Increase hazard trigger frequency by one extra pulse.
- Allow rival team to arrive earlier in the Anchor Vault.

### If party is strained
- Remove one support enemy from each trial.
- Let Warden Ilyra intervene with one protective boon.
- Reduce Chrono-Hydra head count from 5 to 4 at start.

## Reward Cadence

- Session 2: hall loot and blessings
- Session 3: utility relic + consumables + gp equivalent
- Session 4: endpoint relics based on ending
