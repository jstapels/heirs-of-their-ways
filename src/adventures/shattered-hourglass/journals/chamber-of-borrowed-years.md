# Chamber of Borrowed Years

*Location: Lower Temple Trial 1*

## Area Description

> *Marble figures of the same face at different ages ring a silent fountain. Amber water hangs above the basin, refusing to fall. The room smells like old parchment and rain.*

## Conflict

### Combat Route (Hard)
- 2 **Temporal Sentinels**
- 1 **Chronal Ooze**

### Alternate Route

Characters may voluntarily offer truthful memory fragments to the chamber:
- Each player gives one short confession, regret, or fear.
- 3 successful checks before 2 failures:
  - [[/check Insight 14]]
  - [[/check Religion 14]]
  - [[/check Persuasion 15]]

Success deactivates sentinels and grants advantage on one saving throw each in the next chamber.
