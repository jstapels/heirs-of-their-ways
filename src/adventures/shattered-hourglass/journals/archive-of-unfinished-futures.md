# Archive of Unfinished Futures

*Location: Lower Temple Trial 2*

## Area Description

> *Stone shelves slide and reshuffle on their own, whispering names and events that have not happened. On each tablet, scratched notes describe futures that fork and die.*

## Conflict

### Combat Route (Hard)
- 1 Chrono-Mage Adept
- 2 **Echo Blades**
- 1 Flickerswarm

### Alternate Route

The party can chart a safe route through the archive by completing:
- [[/check Arcana 16]]
- [[/check Investigation 15]]

If both checks succeed before two failures, the party bypasses guardian activation and recovers one bonus clue for the final chamber.
