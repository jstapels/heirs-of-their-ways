# The Fractured Causeway

*Location: Outer approach to the Shattered Hourglass temple*

## Area Description

> *A bridge of blackened stone cuts across a canyon filled with hanging gears and broken bells. Chains sway without wind. Every step echoes twice, once now and once a heartbeat later.*

The causeway is the adventure's opener and establishes temporal instability before the party reaches the hall.

## Encounter Options

Choose one:

### Temporal Raiders (Hard)
- 1 veteran captain
- 4 scouts
- 1 **Chrono-Mage Adept**

### Shatterquake Swarm (Hard)
- Environmental collapse in initiative order
- 3 temporal predators (mix of Flickerswarm and Echo Blade)

## Alternate Resolution

The party can bypass direct combat with:
- [[/check Deception 16]] to pose as sanctioned relic recovery agents
- [[/check Survival 15]] to find a side ledge and flank route

On success, reduce attrition before the Hall of Echoing Moments.
