# Hall of Echoing Moments - DM Notes

## Encounter Difficulty

Designed for 4 strong level 7 characters.

**Encounter XP (Strong Party Baseline):**
- Chrono-Drifter (CR 5): 1,800 XP
- Flickerswarm x3 (CR 2): 1,350 XP
- Sporeling Colony (CR 3): 700 XP

**Total:** 3,850 XP (Hard-Deadly once terrain pressure is applied)

Terrain and puzzle elements increase the complexity while giving the party tools to leverage.

## Pacing

- Initial exploration and discovery: 10-15 minutes
- Combat with scavengers: 40-55 minutes
- Door puzzle and roleplay: 15-25 minutes

**Total:** 65-100 minutes

## Running the Chamber

**Temporal Echoes:**
- Use the ancestral combat loop as a visual reminder that the party is retracing history.
- If a player mirrors an ancestor's action (e.g., defending a friend or singing to shift reality), let the echo briefly synchronize with them.

**Unstable Tiles:**
- Keep the grid effects unpredictable but consistent once revealed.
- Let the scavengers avoid certain tiles; that behavior is a legitimate clue.
- For this stronger-party version, trigger a temporal pressure pulse at initiative count 10 in rounds 2 and 4.

**Fallen Pillar:**
- Use the weight limit to create tactical tension for Threk.
- If the pillar collapses, it should create a new hazard but not a dead end.

## Adjusting Difficulty

**Easier Options:**
- Remove one Flickerswarm
- Allow the ancestral symbols to activate as actions instead of bonus actions
- Trap tiles only trigger on a failed save by 5 or more
- Remove the initiative-10 pressure pulses

**Harder Options:**
- Add a second Chrono-Drifter (younger, 60 HP)
- Sporeling Colony regeneration becomes 10 HP/turn
- Trap tiles trigger on entering and leaving
- Flickerswarms can use Temporal Scatter once per turn instead of as a reaction

## Truth Door Roleplay

**Goal:** Give each player a personal, memorable moment.

Tips:
- Do not rush. Let silence breathe.
- If stuck, ask a leading question: "What does Mishko regret?" or "What is Threk afraid of?"
- Accept any genuine truth; the door does not require a specific answer.
- If a truth lands well, briefly show an ancestor's approving gesture.

**Failure Condition:**
- A lie or refusal triggers 2d6 psychic damage. Let the door allow a second attempt.

## Connecting Past and Present

Emphasize:
- Evidence of the ancestral fight (armor fragments, scorched stone, fallen pillar)
- The ancestral symbols respond only to their descendants
- The journal entries show the ancestors as flawed, hopeful people
- The one-time blessings feel like gifts across time

The door opening should feel like a passing of the torch.

## Transition to the Next Encounter

The party descends into the temple chamber where the Chrono-Hydra waits. They now have:

- Partial notes about the hydra's heads and temporal properties
- One-time ancestral blessings
- Possible extra resources from the scavengers
- The emotional weight of legacy and unfinished business

Use the glowing amber pulse below to foreshadow the Chrono-Hydra's presence.
