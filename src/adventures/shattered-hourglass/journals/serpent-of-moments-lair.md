# Serpent of Moments Lair

*Location: Final chamber of the Shattered Hourglass temple*

## Area Description

> *A flooded amphitheater of fractured dials and carved stone terraces descends around a cracked hourglass monolith. In its reflection, time runs in the wrong direction.*

## Boss

- **Serpent of Moments (Chrono-Hydra)**

## Lair Traits

- Initiative count 20: lair action (dragged second, fracture wave, or echoed strike)
- Unstable zones: entering marked squares triggers [[/save DEX 15]] or [[/damage 2d6 force]]
- Severed heads regrow unless the hydra took fire damage before its next turn

## Endings

### Slay
Destroy the hydra and collapse the lair's active temporal node.

### Reseal
Run a 4-success ritual challenge during combat:
- [[/check Arcana 16]]
- [[/check Religion 15]]
- [[/check Athletics 15]]
- [[/check Insight 15]]

### Bargain-With-Cost
Offer a binding condition and recurring obligation that satisfies containment.
