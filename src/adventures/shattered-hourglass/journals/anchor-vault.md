# The Anchor Vault

*Location: Lower Temple Trial 3*

## Area Description

> *A circular chamber of chained hourglasses hangs above black water. One chain is freshly snapped. Broken glass floats in slow circles, never touching the floor.*

## Core Scene

This chamber introduces the rival faction before the finale.

### Rival Strike Team (Hard-Deadly)
- **Kestrel Vane**
- 1 veteran
- 3 scouts
- 1 mage apprentice

### Alternate Resolution

Kestrel can be bargained with:
- [[/check Persuasion 16]] + meaningful concession (loot split, access rights, or nonaggression pact)

On success, Kestrel withdraws and provides one practical warning about the Chrono-Hydra's lair timing.
