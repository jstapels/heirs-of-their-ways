# Session 25 - Into the Grinder / The Bone Mill Descent

## Overview

The party battles through the mill's grinding room, descends into the annex, confronts the necromancer Malrik Veynor, and defeats the monstrous Marrow Titan to secure an Aether Orb.

## Key Events

### The Grinding Room

The party pushed deeper into the mill's grinding room—churning belts, hammering presses, and a roaring furnace that turned the floor itself into a hazard.

**Combat Highlights:**
- Mats sprang ahead using Rabbit Hop to clear a gap, then skittered off a conveyor with his climbing cape
- Skeletal archers pelted Mishko with arrows from range
- A hulking "flesh column" (stitched automaton) waded straight for Threk
- The automaton smashed into Threk with brutal, crackling blows

### The Apprentice and the Levers

A cowering apprentice revealed the mill's cruel logic. When Mats and Threk began to hem in the grinder automaton, the boy stood, yanked one of three levers behind his desk, and a charged cable spat lightning into the machine—knitting its wounds. Then, panicked, he dove back to his hiding place.

**The Foreman:**
- Shouted orders and threats through the furnace's heat shimmer
- Hurled searing necrotic flames at Mats
- Spat names: **Lucien**—the master he swore would grind them down—and **Malrik**, who would "have his way" with them if they didn't run

### Grinding Down the Resistance

The group found their rhythm:
- Mishko's magic bathed the flesh construct in soft radiance
- Threk traded punishing blows despite the creature's thunderous slams
- Mats mixed precise grapples with caustic and thunderous strikes
- The automaton staggered on the brink of collapse
- The foreman rattled, the levers still humming with dangerous promise

### Into the Annex

Pushing past the grinding room, the party found:
- A dock on the wheel-side
- A skiff used to ferry bone and meal
- A chained brake rig on the waterwheel

They reached the annex—its door webbed with warding glyphs that answered the strange "skeleton key" Ilizar carried. As the key turned, sigils guttered out and a distant, mournful wail faded beneath the floor.

**The Cavern:**
- Hewn stone steps into breathless cold
- Lantern-dimness and sour air
- Switchback stairs into a cavern veined by stagnant pools pulsing sickly blue
- Two rune-pylons hissed with power
- Their light bled into a man cradling a small, teal-lit sphere

### Malrik's Gambit

The figure named himself **Malrik Veynor**, a necromancer in Lucien's shadow. He boasted he was drawing up the pit's buried death to charge the **Aether Orb**, and that both Varrick and Lucien knew the party would come.

**The "Compromise":**
He offered that the heroes should return to their new tavern and await his orders. The party tested his temper with questions; Threk's subtle suggestion shattered on Malrik's will, and his politeness curdled to murder.

**The Battle:**
- Bone-shards lanced from the earth
- A marrow-wind slashed in a cone
- Skeleton swarm boiled up from the floor
- Mats blurred forward, hammering Malrik with force and thunder
- Threk drove radiant steel through necrotic flesh, smiting until the necromancer's body withered like paper in a forge

Malrik fell—yet the Aether Orb did not.

### The Marrow Titan

*"Witness me,"* a layered voice intoned as the orb pulsed.

**The Transformation:**
- Bones tore free from every pile, spiraling into a storm
- Pylons shrieked
- Ribs knit into colossal plates
- Vertebrae stacked like mill gears
- A horned skull locked into place
- The orb seated itself as a glowing heart
- The **Marrow Titan** stood, wrapped in a scything cyclone of bone

**The Final Battle:**
- The titan trampled and slammed, dragging more skeletons from the heaps
- Inside a blinding bonestorm, Threk held the line by sense and faith
- Mats found purchase with concussive blows that disrupted the lattice
- Ilizar's radiant shots knifed through gaps
- Mishko's barbs and bolstering kept the press from breaking
- When Threk's radiance and Mats's thunder finally cracked the sternum, the orb flickered bone-white
- Seams webbed across the giant's frame
- The construct **collapsed inward**—a thunder of splintering ivory and teal sparks

### Spoils and Shadows

With the titan ruined, its storm died and skeleton swarms clattered to stillness.

**Loot Secured:**
- **Aether Orb (necrotic aspect)** - The prize
- **Marrow Shard** - Ilizar absorbed as the **Aspect of the Bone**
- **Heart Container Relic** - Crystalline artifact
- **Folding Boat** - Clever magical item
- Jeweled trinkets
- Bars of precious metal
- A king's purse of coin

## Notable Details

- Ilizar gained a new power: Aspect of the Bone
- The skeleton key Ilizar carried opened the annex

## Aftermath

The party withdrew to the Bottomless Goat to lick wounds, weigh guardianship of the orb, and decide which power—fae ally, church vault, or their own Bastion—can keep death's lantern from darker hands.

**Open Questions:**
- Whether pawn or provocateur, each enemy now knows the heroes hold an orb
- The mill's secret is ash—what will be the consequences?
- Who should guard the Aether Orb?
