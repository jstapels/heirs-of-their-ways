# Session 18 - Hammer and Hags

## Key Events

### Clash Under the Moonlight

After a fierce and unsettling encounter, the party found themselves facing off with Liora and her lycanthropic companions. Combat continued when Liora viciously attacked Ilizar, leaving him cursed with lycanthropy. The brutal battle seemed poised to rage on until everyone was slain, but a form of truce was struck and the lycanthropes retreated into the shadows with Brannor's body.

### An Unexpected Inheritance

With the farm in shambles, the party solemnly buried Wulfric, mourning the loss of the old farmer and considering the uncertain future of the property. Their mourning was short-lived, however, as the pragmatic Mina Gainswell, a tax assessor for House Escrinos, arrived with impeccable timing to collect Wulfric's substantial back taxes.

Seeing opportunity rather than ruin, the party quickly paid the debts, becoming proud new owners of a battered, bloodstained sheep farm.

### A Bargain with Builders

Their quiet recovery was interrupted by the arrival of Edric Stonebeard and his fellow craftsmen—Serena, Willmar, and Gwyneth. Edric had a curious tale to tell of his beloved ancestral hammer, Builder's Grace, swindled away by a mysterious old woman named Baba, along with an enchanted golden twine.

Offering a deal, Edric proposed he and his crew could transform the farm into a bustling tavern if only the adventurers would recover his cherished hammer.

### Secrets of the Watering Hole

Setting this quest aside momentarily, Mishko was drawn back to the mysterious depths of the watering hole, convinced secrets lay hidden beneath. After diving deep, he encountered a beautiful yet perilous underwater landscape. Within, he discovered ancient ruins and a mysterious magical helmet—but also awakened three sinister sea hags guarding the depths. Narrowly escaping with his life and the helmet, Mishko resurfaced shaken but triumphant.

Above ground, the party spent some time resting and regaining their strength. Mishko identified the helmet as a Helm of Telepathy, a useful boon claimed by Threk. Meanwhile, the enigmatic Mr. Tip-Dip revealed his unusual magical nature to Mishko, mysteriously producing a magical rope, further deepening the strange allure surrounding their goat companion.

### Into the Fog

Edric had provided a riddle:

> Where fowl feet mark the glade so neat
> No tender bloom nor bright warmth greet
> A hidden brood in crimson crowned
> Shall scrape the earth no soul unbound.
>
> At the trunk laid low, your crossing's found
> 'Neath branches bent in hush profound
> Hark the cackle in quiet air
> For deals twist tongues of those who dare.

The following day, the party set out southwest into the forest, guided only by Edric's riddle and determined to reclaim Builder's Grace. The hunt led them through an eerie woodland marked by massive chicken-like tracks and growing fog, signs consistent with Baba's presence. After crossing a precarious fallen tree bridge and pressing onward, the party was ambushed by malicious red-capped fey creatures lurking in the mist.
