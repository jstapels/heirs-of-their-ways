# Session 24 - Smoke at the Goat, Mist at the Mill

## Key Events

### Buttoning Down for the Night

As the hearth in the Bottomless Goat dwindled to low embers, the party weighed the previous night's visit and what it implied for Briar Hollow. They checked doors, joked darkly about things that slip through cracks, and set their evening rhythms. With the tension still in the air, each hero settled into their own ritual of rest and readiness, the tavern's new timbers creaking softly above a quiet street.

Night passed in fitful calm—no knocks at the shutters, no signs of prowling eyes—just the ordinary susurrus of a small valley town. By dawn, the Goat smelled of woodsmoke and yesterday's stew, and the group had the sense that the decisions they made next would ripple beyond their own walls.

### Discovering the Bastions

Morning brought the practical work of making the Bastion real. The party stood the four quarters, each taking a point to anchor their warding oath, and felt the place take on a subtle weight—like a breath held and released.

They gave the Goat its first shape:
- A **sanctuary to Shyhad**
- A **library and arcade study**
- **Plots of green for a living garden** below
- A **proper workshop kitted with chosen tools**

Talk turned to who might staff the place and what trades would make it hum; for the first time, the Bastion felt less like a dream and more like a promise.

With those choices set, they fixed the Goat's place in Briar Hollow's weave—near the market run and within earshot of the well. The plan was simple: establish roots, earn trust, and use the Bastion as a lantern for the work ahead.

### Exploring the Town

They spent the day learning Briar Hollow's rhythm. A circuit around the green showed:
- Stables
- A broad schoolhouse
- The church spire
- The usual knots of cottage and cart

Mishko went hunting for smokes and instead found a Loxodon tending the hives at the apiary—**Bhel**, all warm patience and honey-sweet humor—who sent him toward Raine's Bounty for proper trade.

From friendly chatter they learned:
- The town keeps its spirits with small gatherings between the bigger festivals
- The mayor—a steady woman—sets the tone when times are lean
- Traffic through the Vale has thinned, and folk have grown cautious

No one pointed a finger outright, but talk had a way of drifting toward the river and the old works downstream. By late afternoon, the party had enough threads to choose a direction—and a reason.

### Heading to the Old Mill

They followed Whisperwind Creek until the valley opened like a green hand, and the air turned strange. A chalky mist hugged the banks and dulled sound; water sheared white against stone, and a low bridge arched slick with lichen.

Downriver, the mill hunched like a sleeping thing, gear-teeth filmed with pale deposits. Near the wheelhouse they found:
- A rusted winch on its chain
- Stained crates (one split)
- A coil of twine
- A bucket
- The faint cider-sweet smell of old cargo

They crept up on the squat Stone Annex—mortar black with moss, a narrow slit window, and a thick oak door bound in iron with an iron ring at its side—and paused to take stock of the lock and the rough steps leading down inside it.

Ilizar volunteered to try picking it (his hand jerking out and pulling back as if arguing with itself), but the party quickly learned this was no ordinary tumbler: the lock's face was ringed with tiny, **necromantic runes** and built to be opened by a particular skeleton key.

When it looked like brute force or a long hunt for a key might be the only options, Mishko stepped forward and cast **dispel magic**—the warding runes flared as they resisted, then snapped out, the lock's enchantments visibly disabled and the way into the annex suddenly much more real. Despite them feeling safer now, Ilizar's attempts to thwart the lock were unsuccessful; it would seem a key would be needed.

Continuing on, tracks told an uneasy tale—several to the water's edge, only one set returning. The wheel thumped steadily in its sluice, indifferent to whoever had come and gone. The party drew steel and breath at the bridge's crown, eyes on the broken dock and the dark slit of the mill's mouth, and prepared to cross into whatever worked behind that fog.
