# Session 12 - A Wolf in Sheep's Shadows

## Overview

The party debates returning to Loamvale versus pressing on to Rivermeet, ultimately choosing to head home. During their journey, they experience increasingly ominous nights before being attacked by wolves led by a terrifying Shadow Dire Wolf. Upon returning to Loamvale, they face unexpected accusations from the Council.

### Return to Loamvale

**Arrival:**
- Weary but victorious
- Not met with expected celebration
- Summoned to appear before Council of Loamvale

**Council Meeting:**
- Held outside Blackthorn Estate villa
- Air thick with scent of fine wines and weight of judgment
- Ilizar chooses to skip out, not wanting to report

**Council Members Present:**
- Alejandro Escrinos
- Matriarch Tona Shadowtusk
- Bram Yran
- Josep Wolansk
- Montebank Blackthorn
- Aldric Stormwind

**The Accusation:**
- Party presents findings and proof of neutralized bandit threat
- Victory turns sour when they hand over mysterious note from 'L.D.'
- Note unknowingly implicates them in conspiracy

**The Altered Note:**

> To Mishko, Threk, and Motiejus,
>
> Your efforts in disrupting the shipments from Loamvale are commendable. The chaos you've sown is already yielding results. Continue to block the river passage and ensure no goods reach Rivermeet. Your reward will be substantial once our objectives are met.
>
> Remember, secrecy is paramount. Do not fail me.
>
> — L.D.

**Council Reactions:**
- Immediate and divided
- Alejandro Escrinos and Josep Wolansk particularly skeptical
- Question why note suggests party deliberately interfered with trade
- Montebank Blackthorn remains unreadable
- Bram Yran more intrigued than accusatory
- Aldric Stormwind takes evidence gravely
- Suggests further investigation needed before judgment

**Party's Defense:**
- Best efforts to argue innocence
- Council not fully convinced
- Note serves as damning evidence
- Family histories make them outsiders within own houses
- Party in precarious position

**Verdict:**
- Confined to house arrest
- Investigation continues into what really happened
