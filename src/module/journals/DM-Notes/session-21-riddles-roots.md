# Session 21 - Riddles, Roots, and Really Bad Luck

## Key Events

The heroes, having survived Baba Yaga's surreal hut so far, found themselves battered but determined, with more strange ingredients to collect for their impish "host," Zzyzx.

### The Dream Room and the Sobbing Tree

Shaking off lingering confusion, the party tangled with dream-haunted myconids and cleverly avoided needless violence by talking their way to a prize: **Dream Blossom Petals**.

With this room cleared, they pressed on and discovered a sorrowful, blighted treant. Through Sylvan words, psychic outreach, and a lot of guesswork, the party learned the tree yearned for rescue—its essence transplanted in new, clean soil. With care (and a lucky nature check), they convinced the tree to trust them, received a clump of **amber sap**, and secured the tree's soul in a pot for future replanting. As a bonus, they discovered a **bottle of antitoxin** hidden nearby.

### Webs, Spiders, and Secret Doors

Next, they faced a corridor with cobwebs—so thick that Mats had to carefully slice only the right webs to avoid collapse. Mats and Ilizar snuck through with feline grace, but Threk and Mishko made enough noise to wake the dead.

Inside, the group encountered a den of giant wolf spiders and a glittering phase spider, all tangled around a cleverly hidden secret door. After a tense battle—complete with missed swings, clever use of elemental powers, and Threk's final blow "chopping" the head off the spider with his rapier—they prevailed. Mats expertly carved open the phase spider and found the elusive **glitter silk egg sac**.

### The Quickling's Game and the Golden Acorn

Moving on, the party stumbled into a room overflowing with golden acorns and a jittery quickling who challenged them to a series of riddles in exchange for prizes. Threk wagered mead, Ilizar lost a whistle (which he later traded back), and Threk solved riddles with style (and a bit of meta-game grumbling).

In the end, after much verbal sparring and clever play, the party won a magical **World Seed Acorn**, a few gems, and a pair of boots.

### The Fiery Kitchen, Cat, and Hellhounds

Another chamber brought a surreal kitchen, a grumpy hellhound, a mischievous displacer cat, and more culinary confusion. Attempts to feed or calm the hellhound failed (turns out, apples aren't a universal favorite), and when tempers flared, the party found themselves fighting the hounds and the displacer cat.

After a bruising combat and some lucky punches, Mats knocked out a **hellhound fang**—one more item for their list. Ilizar also discovered a locked cabinet with four **potions of greater healing**.

### The Haunted Kennels

The penultimate challenge led to cages filled with spectral animals and a ghostly child named Elise, imprisoned by Baba Yaga. With kindness and calm words, Ilizar and the party freed the girl, earning her heartfelt gratitude and a **spectral blessing**—a magic boon for the future.

The party then focused on calming a caged blink dog to retrieve its magical collar, but a run of poor rolls left the group stymied: the lock refused to yield, and the collar remained just out of reach as the session closed.
