# Session 16 - The Cursed Bag

## Key Events

The party's travels brought them to a roadside camp where they encountered Vesmer and his band of fey misfits: Zib-Zib (a whimsical fairy), Piper (a mischievous satyr), Riff (an extremely quick rogue-like fey), and Nix (a quiet, blue-skinned figure). They invited the group to share stories around the campfire, offering a friendly—if somewhat suspicious—atmosphere.

### Stories Around the Campfire

Each party member shared a tale:
- **Mishko** performed a ballad about Threk and his tragic encounter with Aveline's spirit
- **Motiejus** reluctantly shared a sorrowful tale about losing his beloved, while under the influence of Piper's charming music
- **Threk** recited an ancient Loxodon poem about Aserus, a revered druidic figure
- **Vesmer** and his companions told cryptic fey stories of cursed names and strange artifacts, hinting they each possessed shady pasts

Throughout the evening, Riff attempted to pick the party's pockets, and Zib-Zib giggled at the group's curiosity about hidden secrets. An uneasy sense that something was "off" lingered as the night deepened.

### Fortune Telling Inside the Wagon

Later, Vesmer invited the adventurers into his ornately decorated wagon for a fortune reading. Inside, draped in purple curtains and arcane symbols, he shuffled worn tarot cards and revealed:

1. **The Wanderer** - Signifying the party's restless path
2. **The Veiled One** - Suggesting hidden truths and ever-present watchers
3. **The Maw** - A twisted image of a ravenous mouth, implying a looming, hungry entity

The reading took an ominous turn when Vesmer abruptly opened a cursed bag of holding—one apparently housing the malicious entity from the cards.

### Pulled Into the Cursed Bag

In an instant, most of the party (and eventually all but a couple of the fey) were sucked into the bag, dropping them into a broken dimension where disjointed scraps of reality floated aimlessly. Old bones, half-eaten pages, and debris tumbled through endless void. A single massive candle flickered in the distance, offering dim, haunting light.

Separated in time by a few seconds or "rounds," each hero found themselves falling/floating toward a ruined map suspended in this chaotic space. The realm felt fragile, like it was a prison for a devouring horror that demanded constant feeding.

### Combat with the Void Maw

A grotesque Void Maw erupted into view—an enormous, gaping mouth encircled by spiraling teeth and writhing tendrils. It lashed out with psychic screams and tried to devour the group:

- Threk, Motiejus, Ilizar, and eventually Mishko landed on the floating terrain and fought the abomination
- The Maw inflicted psychic damage, pulled victims with tendrils, and warped space around it, attempting to feed on their souls
- Despite its disturbing powers, the party overcame the Void Maw, cutting through its unnatural flesh until it collapsed

With its death, the bag's warped pocket dimension imploded. Everyone reappeared back in the wagon's vicinity, crashing from several feet in the air. Though battered, they freed themselves—and the fey—from the bag's accursed hunger. The bag of holding itself lay in useless tatters.

### Conversation With Vesmer's Group Afterwards

Once free, Vesmer's band dropped their playful act and confessed they had been forced to feed travelers to the Maw. If they refused, the bag devoured one of them instead. Though Vesmer regretted deceiving the party, he insisted they had "no choice" until someone strong enough could destroy the Maw.

Grateful to be free from the curse, the fey offered a strange goat as a "gift"—a creature they could never explain, but which seemed uncommonly calm and never slept. The party, still wary of their betrayers, accepted the goat and parted ways, deciding that any further conflict wasn't worth it now that the Maw was destroyed.

### Meeting Wulfric

Travel continued toward Briar Hollow, where fields were poorly tended or abandoned. The party arrived at a modest sheep barn owned by a gruff farmer named Wulfric. Initially hostile—mistaking them for tax collectors—he relaxed after Mishko offered a precious bottle of Torvaldr whiskey.

Wulfric explained that something was savaging or stealing his sheep nightly, sometimes brutally leaving carcasses behind. The area, long neglected since the Darkwood family left, has fallen into disrepair. Wulfric begged the party to help stop the nightly attacks, and they agreed to investigate.
