# Session 17 - Wererats, Wolves, and Wulfric Woes

## Key Events

After striking a deal with Wulfric Hallowbane to investigate the mysterious sheep disappearances, the party spent the day exploring his land.

### Exploring the Watering Hole

The party investigated the watering hole where the attacks seemed to be happening—an ancient stone-ringed pool of water, far too deep for a simple farm pond. While Threk and the others studied the area above ground, Mishko dove into the waters to investigate.

What he found below was no mere pond—it was the entrance to a vast, subterranean grotto, a hidden river leading deeper into unknown caverns. Though tempted to explore further, Mishko returned to the surface to share his findings.

Wanting to rule out other entry points, they expanded their search southwest toward the edge of the woods. The deeper they went, the more unsettling the surroundings became. The usual sounds of nature were absent—no birds, no rustling of small animals, only eerie silence. Eventually, the group decided to return and prepare an ambush for whatever creatures had been preying upon Wulfric's flock.

### The Trap

As night fell, the adventurers set their trap. Mishko and Mats played the part of careless shepherds, while Threk, Ilizar, and the ever-silent Mr. Tip Dip (the mysterious, unsleeping goat) took their places in the shadows.

For hours, nothing happened. The occasional bleating of sheep was the only sound in the night. Then, at last, Threk caught the scent of blood on the air. Moments later, figures emerged from the darkness.

### Moonlight Battle with Wererats

A group of humanoid figures stepped into the moonlight—at first glance, they seemed like common thugs. But as they approached, their forms twisted, bones cracking, bodies elongating. Soon, they stood transformed—hideous, hybrid creatures of man and rat. Wererats. One of them sneered, calling the party "tasty morsels," and before they could strike, Mishko conjured a fog cloud, obscuring their approach.

The battle erupted in the moonlit field:
- Threk waded into battle with divine fury, cutting through his foes with radiant strikes
- Mats was a flurry of kicks and jabs, dancing between opponents with strikes crackling with elemental energy
- Ilizar fired precision shots from the shadows, each arrow finding its mark
- Mishko kept enemies at bay with strategic spellwork, summoning a cloud of daggers that shredded one of the wererats who attempted to flee

Despite their ferocity, the lycanthropes were no match for the party's coordination and raw power. Most of the creatures lay dead, save for a single captured survivor.

As the defeated wererat sneered through bloody teeth, he revealed a chilling truth: they were not alone. Their leader, Brannor, was already south at Wulfric's farm. The words barely left his mouth before Ilizar and Mishko were sprinting back, their allies close behind.

### Wulfric's Death

When they arrived at the farm, it was already too late.

The scene was grim—fires raged in the fields, the bodies of slaughtered sheep littered the ground, and Wulfric himself lay motionless, blood pooling beneath him. Standing amid the carnage were more were-creatures, this time joined by a monstrous wereboar—Brannor himself. His pack stood at his side, their claws dripping with fresh blood.

The party barely had time to catch their breath before the were-creatures turned to face them, and another battle erupted. Unlike the wererats, these foes were larger, stronger—true hunters. The fight was brutal:
- Brannor, in his blood frenzy, tore into the party with savage strikes, but was met with the unyielding force of Threk's divine wrath
- Mishko's spells provided healing and blades of magic cut through the enemy ranks
- Ilizar and Mats struck with precision and agility

### The Unexpected Arrival

Then, the unexpected happened. A new figure entered the fray—a were-harengon, bounding across the battlefield with frightening speed. Mats froze. He knew her.

**Liora.**

She pounced on Threk and scolded her were-companions. However, the fight came to an abrupt pause as she stared at Mats, recognition dawning in her eyes. "Mats? You're alive?"

She urged her companions to retreat back to Vargr's camp, but Ilizar couldn't help having the last word: "You know what? Go. You are the lucky ones today. Let's see. We lost zero and you lost one, two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, go."

The werewolves and weretiger were enraged at this and turned a deathly stare on Ilizar, their anger freshly renewed.

## NPCs Encountered

- **Wulfric Hallowbane** - Gruff farmer, killed by Brannor's pack
- **Brannor** - Wereboar leader of the were-creature pack
- **Liora** - Were-harengon, Mats' former acquaintance
- **Wererats** - Multiple creatures attacking sheep
- **Werewolves and weretiger** - Members of Brannor's pack

## Combat Encounters

- Moonlit battle against wererats at the watering hole
- Brutal fight at Wulfric's farm against Brannor's pack (wereboar, werewolves, weretiger)
- Interrupted by Liora's arrival and recognition of Mats

## Cliffhanger

The session ended with tension at its peak—Liora recognized Mats, the were-creatures were enraged by Ilizar's taunting, and the party stood amid the carnage of Wulfric's farm, uncertain whether the fight would resume or if the lycanthropes would truly retreat.
