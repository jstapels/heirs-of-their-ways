# World of Aevir - Overview

The campaign takes place in the world of **Aevir**, specifically in the region of **Loamvale** within **Mikill Fyrir**.

## Major Regions

### Mikill Fyrir
The larger nation/continent where Loamvale is located. Key areas include:
- **Loamvale** - The valley region where the campaign is centered
- **Shadow's End** - City where Threk trained with the Ascendency Guild

### Xorketh
Northern neighboring region. The Hunters have been dealing with events along this border.

### Maru'took
The traditional homeland of Loxodons, far from Loamvale. The Shadowtusks claim descent from exiles.

## The Feywild Collision

A catastrophic event in the distant past merged portions of the Feywild with Mikill Fyrir. This collision:
- Scattered the Aether Orbs across the Material Plane
