# Fey Allies & Phantoms

Supernatural beings the party has encountered, ranging from helpful to mischievous to melancholic.

## Archfey

### Luminara
*Guardian of the Feygrove*

Appeared in a hidden waterfall grotto like morning light through leaves - radiant, composed, and constrained by old laws. Spoke of the Aether Orbs as balances carried from the Feywild, cautioning against bending them to mortal will.

**Status:** Active (benevolent)

**Location:** Serene grotto accessible through the fey fountain puzzle

**Role:** Laid quiet blessings on each party member. Her concern is for harmony, not victory.

**Interactions:** Return with offerings or honest questions about the orbs and paths between realms - find a patient teacher who will not shield you from the costs of your choices.

**Blessings Given:**
- **Aspect of Grounded Resolve** (Threk) - Tremorsense and saves vs. push/prone
- Additional blessings to other party members

## Fey Tricksters

### Cornelius
*The Almost-Helpful Satyr*

A shaggy-armed, bare-foot fey who delights in being almost helpful. Scolded the party about a stolen rose, then slipped it into Threk's pack "for safekeeping."

**Status:** Active (mischievous ally)

**Notable Action:** When things turned dire against Mara, his peculiar potion turned the tide - proof that mischief can be mercy wearing a sideways grin.

**Approach:** Trades secrets for sweets or shinies. Hears everything that brushes the treeline.

**Assessment:** Weather vane for the fey - never entirely reliable, rarely malicious, very aware of which way the wind is turning.

### The Fey Bandits (Vesmir's Group)

**Members:** Vesmir, Zibzib, Riff, Piper, and Nyx

Wagon-roving crew that presented as highwaymen with too much charm and too little luck. Their crimes traced back to a cursed extradimensional bag demanding sacrifices to the Void Maw within - the gang was as trapped as their victims.

**Status:** Active (reformed, grateful)

**Resolution:** Once the Maw was destroyed, their relief was genuine, posture softened from predatory to penitent.

**Debt Paid:** Gifts, gossip, and guidance off the main road.

**Member Roles:**
- **Vesmir** - Talks deals
- **Nyx** - Watches shadows
- **Piper & Riff** - Keep spirits high
- **Zibzib** - Collects oddities, knows where "the Hut with chicken feet" sometimes walks

**Assessment:** Morally gray but currently inclined to wave the party through.

## Ghosts & Spirits

### Aveline Rosewood
*The Rose Garden Ghost*

Appeared as tender ghost of a half-elf gardener, bound to an overgrown memorial where grief had turned wild and thorned. Her sadness animated brambles defending the graves, yet music and compassion steadied her enough to ask for help.

**Status:** At Peace (departed)

**Story:** Young half-elf who tended a magnificent rose garden. Fell in love with traveling bard Thorian who promised to return but died in distant lands. Heartbroken, she died in a storm searching for a rare bloom.

**Resolution:** The party tamed her overgrown garden (difficult battle against animated rose monsters). In thanks, she offered small living tokens before finally finding peace.

**Gifts Given:**
- Root-woven wand (vine/control effect)
- Thorn-kissed ring (charming effect, thorns grew into Threk's finger)

**Legacy:** Reminder that not every restless spirit is a foe, and Loamvale earth remembers kindness.

### Elise
*Ghost Child of Baba Yaga's Hut*

Pale, soft-voiced child spirit met inside Baba Yaga's Hut - more echo than breath, clutching threadbare doll and humming a lullaby that never finds its last note.

**Status:** At Peace (released by Mishko)

**Behavior:** When treated gently, pointed toward safer passages. Fell quiet when the Hut's temper rose, vanishing at mention of "Grandmother."

**Resolution:** In a bittersweet moment, Mishko promised to give Elise peace. With a whispered apology, he released her spirit with a well-aimed Starry Wisp. Her body glowed bright white before vanishing.

**Final Gift:** A Remove Curse gem - parting gratitude from the grateful ghost.

## Hut Denizens

### Zzyzx
*The Bellhop Imp*

A winged imp in a too-crisp bellhop uniform, equal parts concierge and customs officer for Baba Yaga's Hut. Greets intruders like guests who forgot their reservation - snide, theatrical, very interested in payment up front.

**Status:** Unknown (possibly escaped with party, possibly not)

**Services Rendered:**
- Shared a volatile recipe (ingredients listed, consequences unstated) that might jolt the Hut into ejecting them
- Offered breezy "safety tips"
- Extracted a promise or two

**Last Seen:** Darting toward same doorway as party when the cauldron roared. Whether he slipped out remains deliciously unclear.

**Future Contact:** If the Hut walks Loamvale's roads again, Zzyzx may answer a polite ring - helpful in the way a contract is helpful, with strings knotted tight.

## Related Artifacts

### Aether Orbs
Fey artifacts that serve as balances carried from the Feywild. Luminara cautioned against bending them to mortal will. Multiple factions are competing for these objects:
- The Shadow Conspiracy seeks them
- Selene appeared focused on one that "answered her presence"
- Malrik Veynor charged a necrotic version in the Bone Mill

### The Cursed Rose
Originally stolen by Cornelius from Aveline's grave, forced upon Threk. Led to undead attacks and eventually the encounter with Aveline's ghost. Now resolved.
