## Biography

> **Warning:** Certain aspects of this character's history are not fully known in-character.

### Early Life

Motiejus was born into the powerful and influential Torvaldr family. Despite not being in line for inheritance, he grew up surrounded by wealth, privilege, and high expectations with education in arts, politics, and martial training. However, he always felt detachment from his family's ambitions.

Growing up on the Torvaldr Estate, he was surrounded by a large, bustling family - siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles all involved in family trades. His early experiences included running through fields, exploring distillery machinery, and listening to stories about Brahm, Hretna, and their whiskey-making legacy.

**Formative Moments:**
- At age four, his grandfather Brahm showed him distilling processes and shared stories about persistence and innovation
- His grandmother Hretna taught him to plant and care for herbs in the family botanical garden, igniting his appreciation for botany and nature

### Adolescent Life

As Mats grew older, differences in family prestige became apparent. Prominent cousins from more prestigious lineages (Asgiers, Kriels) looked down on him due to his connection to the less prestigious Yrjan line.

**The Sabotage Incident:**
Around 15, Mats oversaw a small whiskey batch as training. Envious cousins sabotaged it, leading to a significant mishap. Six months of investigation uncovered the real culprits. During this time, Mats faced family mistrust, causing considerable stress and self-doubt.

Even after clearing his name, trust remained fragile. This taught him vigilance, integrity, and caution - especially around those cousins.

### Early Adulthood

Mats dedicated his early 20s to working in an auxiliary building, refining farming and distilling skills to prove himself.

**Liora:**
He developed a close relationship with **Liora Hren Serin**, a female Harengon from a skilled cartographer family. They shared mutual respect for their trades and love for nature.

During a routine excursion to the northwest Towering Woods, Liora's group was attacked by fierce beasts. Despite rescue efforts, she succumbed to her wounds. This had a profound impact on Mats.

### The Awakening

Mats struggled with deep grief and depression through his 20s and 30s. He began noticing primal shifts in his being as grief evolved into something else.

**The Nightmares:**
- Vivid nightmares reliving Liora's death, though he wasn't present
- Dreams took physical toll - exhaustion, inability to focus
- One nightmare showed the beast surrounded by flames; he awoke to find scorched wall

**The Fire:**
In one particularly vivid nightmare of Liora surrounded by flames, latent elemental energy within Mats erupted into the real world. A fire spread within the Lepus-Lazuli distillery. He sustained severe burns escaping.

The family was suspicious but couldn't prove how it started. The incident left Mats physically and emotionally scarred - burns a constant reminder of his uncontrollable power.

**Hretna's Intervention:**
His grandmother recognized deeper signs and urged Mats to seek monk training to control these manifestations before causing greater harm.

## Family Connection
