# Shadowtusk Estate

The Shadowtusk Estate is a greater household in the Loamvale region, widely known for their outstanding Mead. The Shadowtusks are an extended family of Loxodons who employ other races but maintain family leadership exclusively among Loxodons. The name "Shadowtusk" celebrates the darkened tusks of the family's founder and several progeny.

## Family History

### Origins - The Legend of Shefa
The Shadowtusks claim descent from Shefa, daughter of the legendary Loxodonish hero Surus, born before the World Tree sprouted. According to family lore, Shefa was exiled from Maru'took due to her darkened tusks, which superstitious Loxodons claimed showed Vixnia's evil influence. Surus allegedly did not object, citing Ranu's decree.

*Note: Maru'took Loxodons deny this story entirely, claiming Surus only had three male offspring. Any slight against Surus is dangerous ground with Maru'took Loxodons.*

### Aserus the Founder
The Shadowtusks believe all Loxodons outside Maru'took descend from Shefa's nine children. The middle child, **Aserus**, was the first Loxodon to lead a group to present-day Loamvale. Aserus was a mighty Druid who established the family home in the valley.

### The Nursery Rhyme of Aserus
Every Shadowtusk child learns this rhyme:

> *In ancient woods where shadows play,*
> *A druid wanders, night and day.*
> *Aserus, with staff in hand,*
> *Seeks the secrets of the land.*
>
> *Through Loamwood's depths, he bravely goes,*
> *Where ancient trees in twilight grow.*
> *Their whispered sorrows, he can hear,*
> *With healing songs, he calms their fear.*
>
> *A staff of heartwood, gift divine,*
> *Imbued with power, wisdom's sign.*
> *A guardian now, of nature's grace,*
> *He journeys on, to every place.*
>
> *So let his story guide your way,*
> *With nature's love, both night and day.*
> *For in his steps, we find our own,*
> *A path of harmony, brightly shown.*

The Shadowtusks claim they were the first great family to inhabit the region and believe they should have the greatest say in regional matters. The other families disagree.

## The Shadowtusks Today

The family helps lead Loamvale with four other families. They exhibit serene wisdom but promise severe consequences if provoked. They are loyal but not as rigidly lawful as Maru'took Loxodons. They share a love of art, music, and deep connection to nature spirits.

### The Mead Business
Aserus's oldest child, **Sond**, a natural Druid, established a relationship with honey bees. Over centuries, this honey became the foundation of Shadowtusk Mead.

### Family Lines
Druidic ways passed through generations, with branches into arcane arts, martial combat, and divine worship. Most follow Eunevia or Kasprus rather than Ranu. Not all descendants have darkened tusks, but those who do are celebrated.

### The Estate
The main house, **Norsu**, is said to be as old as Aserus himself - a massive three-story building proportioned for Loxodons. Fields of produce and extensive beehives surround it.

## Important Family Members

### The Six Remaining Elders

**Matriarch Tona** - Current head of family for over 300 years, becoming matriarch very young. Over 420 years old and nearing life's end, she's stepping down to guide a new head. Popular and successful leader from Ooja's line. Her lone offspring, Threk, is viewed as unworthy of leadership.

**Protector Chahos** (Sond's line) - Elder in charge of estate security. Fiercely protective of beehives and recipe. Unfavorable toward other valley families. Near life's end.

**Seeker Tvor** (Ooja's line) - Elder Ranger who knows nearly everything about Loamvale's geography. Still spry and active despite age. Standoffish toward non-Loxodons, attributed to losing one offspring early and another to adventuring. Has dark tusks.

**Conservator Dirjov** (Sond's line) - Senior elder, close cousin of Chahos. His son Takov is expected to be next family head. A Druid, mostly retired, but consulted on important decisions. Has dark tusks.

**Augur Crol** (Sond's line) - Arcane Diviner trained outside the estate. Works closely with Tona using his gifts for decision-making and security. Uniquely dislikes Takov and hasn't offered an alternative successor choice.

**Chef Oso** (Gondros' line) - Lone elder from Gondros's line. Renowned chef specializing in mead-based recipes. Training her youngest grandson as successor.

### Important Adults

**Keeper Takov** (Sond's line) - Head Druid in charge of honey bees. Leading bid to return leadership to Sond's line. Outsiders consider him the sure next head. Has dark tusks.

**Collector Yana** (Sond's line) - Takov's closest cousin, in charge of honey collection.

**Brewer Sarunos** (Ooja's line) - Head brewer of Mead. No interest in leadership, happy perfecting the centuries-old recipe.

**Merchant Dralus** (Ooja's line) - In charge of Mead distribution. Has dark tusks.

**Abjurer Thritun** (Ooja's line) - Practitioner of arcane arts.

**Healer Oa** (Gondros' line) - Youngest of her generation, devout follower of Eunevia. Has three children, intending more. Two children have dark tusks, first in Gondros's line for centuries.

## Family Tree Structure

**Aserus's Three Children:**
- **Sond** (oldest) - Druids, bee keepers, favor green - 9 living descendants
- **Ooja** (middle) - Business acumen, brewing, favor blue - 8 living descendants
- **Gondros** (youngest) - Eclectic, protection focused, favor yellow - 2 living descendants

Leadership has resided in Ooja's line since Sond's death ~1000 years ago.
